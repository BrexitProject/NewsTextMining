Boris Johnson gives a thumbs up as he leaves Selby, North Yorkshire, on a hectic day of campaigning

Mr Johnson has appealed for voters to make the EU referendum Britain's 'Independence Day'

Mr Gove, who confirmed he would be happy to serve in Mr Cameron's Cabinet once the rancorous referendum contest is over, compared the moment Britain stands at in history with the American Revolution.

He said: 'The decision the American Revolutionaries had to make in the 1770s about whether or not to continue to be ruled by someone who was distant and unaccountable, who imposed taxes without listening to their voices or whether to break free.

'They decided to break free then and America has never looked back and the world had cause to be grateful. There will have been all sorts of people then I imagine saying it is a risk, don't go against the Establishment, can you really survive?

'In five years' time, if we stay in the EU, we will be paying more money to bail out a single currency which is failing. We face the prospect of more EU control over our security, our intelligence services having their hands tied.

'We face the prospect of a rogue European Court making it more difficult for us to deal with terrorism. We also face the prospect of our competitiveness diminishing. My fear is that if we vote to stay in, Britain will be poorer, less safe. I also worry that it will feel and be less fair because the elites and the establishment will have felt they had a great escape.

'They will feel that the moment they could have been held to account and we could have taken control has passed.'
