The eurozone is on the brink of another financial crisis – but leaving the EU would still plunge Britain into recession, the IMF said last night.

In its latest controversial intervention in the referendum campaign, the International Monetary Fund said the eurozone was in danger of being torn apart by political tensions.

It said that while the single currency bloc had recovered over the past six months, the medium-term future looked ‘weak’ and that it was racked by high unemployment and bad debts. It also said the failure of the EU to tackle the refugee crisis had ‘vividly exposed political fault lines’ which threatened the entire European project.

By contrast, the IMF said Britain’s finances were in good health, and it acknowledged that the EU was keen for Britain to remain a member as it faces a ‘critical juncture’.
