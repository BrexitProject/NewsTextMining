'And it is an illusion to think that if we vote to Remain, we are somehow opting for the status quo. 

'The status quo is not on offer. If we stay in, we will be engaged willy-nilly in the desperate attempt to keep the euro together, by building an economic government of Europe.'

Mr Johnson said he wanted to hand 'power back to the people' because democracy was the 'best way of correcting the errors of our people'.

He said: 'Now is the time to believe in ourselves, and in what Britain can do, and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves.

'Of course we can continue to provide leadership and support for Europe – but inter-governmentally, outside the supranational EU system.

'I hope you will vote Leave, and take back control of this great country's destiny; and if we Vote Leave, then all our votes will count for more in the future.

'This chance will not come again in our lifetimes, and I pray we do not miss it.'

Mr Johnson will again be joined by Labour's Gisela Stuart and Tory Andrea Leadsom when he takes to the Wembley Arena stage tomorrow night.
