Leave will not shy away from the topic of immigration entirely though, as it is regarded as the campaign’s strongest subject in contrast to remain’s emphasis on the economy.

On Sunday Gisela Stuart, the Labour chair of Vote Leave, challenged David Cameron to say he would use his veto to stop Turkey entering the EU when he faces a BBC Question Time audience at 6.45pm.

“Both Jeremy Corbyn and George Osborne today said that we should accept having no control over free movement of people into the UK from the EU – we disagree. And senior figures in the In campaign have said that they agree with us.

“‘Government policy and EU policy is to have five more countries join the EU – including Turkey. It’s also their plan to open up visa-free travel from Turkey after our referendum this year. If we stay in the EU then this is bound over time to lead to further movement of people into the UK. Our communities and public services are already under pressure. To make this worse would be a mistake and the only vote we get on this is on Thursday.

“David Cameron should make clear tonight: will he use his veto to stop Turkey joining the EU? Will he stop sending taxpayers’ money to Turkey to help them join the EU? Will he commit to stopping Turkish citizens being given visa-free access to the UK?”
