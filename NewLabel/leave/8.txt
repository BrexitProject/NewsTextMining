Writing in the Daily Telegraph, they said: “There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis.

“They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting remain.”

The spat is the latest blue-on-blue row and comes a day after 65 pro-Brexit Tory MPs warned they would not back an “emergency budget” that Osborne had said was necessary if Britain voted to leave.

On Wednesday night, the home secretary, Theresa May – a likely leadership contender if Cameron resigns following next week’s vote – said she wanted further EU reform on immigration from Europe.

“There are some changes coming up in free-movement rules, to make it easier for us to deal with illegal immigrants, and I think again, as I’ve said, that we should look at further reform in the future,” May told the BBC.

The comments from May, who backs remain but has said little during the campaign, will increase pressure on the prime minister over immigration.

The leading leave campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove wrote to Cameron asking him to “confirm whether it is government policy not to seek any further reforms of EU ‘free movement’ laws and regulations”.

But in her BBC interview May added: “What I’ve learned over six years is there’s no single answer … there’s no one thing you can do that can suddenly deal with all the problems and concerns over immigration and that includes leaving the EU – that’s not the single answer to this.”
