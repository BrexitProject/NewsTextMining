With most of the great and good calling me stupid and racist, I’m starting to think they may be right. I live in a world where the minimum wage is the maximum wage. I wait for a text that allows me to work a 12-hour night shift with working conditions that are worse than when I started working in the 1980s. I’m told that working conditions are better now than ever and will worsen if we leave. I used to get a premium for working nights and weekends. I used to have a common language with my work colleagues, now I’m the one with a language barrier. Sorry, I’m being stupid and racist now. I’m competing for work against Eastern Europeans who are mostly upper-working class and who can earn more doing an unskilled job here than a skilled or semi-skilled job at home. What chance do I have with no qualifications? The jobs I used to do are no longer available to me. But thanks to the EU I can go and work in the east for £2 an hour. Or am I being stupid again?

If you want to help the people at the bottom, please vote to leave. If you want cheap social care, nannies, and cleaners and if you want two for a pound apple turnovers, vote remain. But don’t pretend that you care about the people at the bottom in any way.
