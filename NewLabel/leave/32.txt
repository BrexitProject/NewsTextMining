Tory justice minister and prominent Leave campaigner Dominic Raab slammed EU diktats on removing foreign offenders as ‘dangerous and undemocratic’.

The Supreme Court yesterday heard submissions from lawyers for Home Secretary Theresa May. A ruling is expected later this year.

Dangerous criminals including rapists, killers and paedophiles are able to move freely into Britain because of failures in data-sharing among European nations, a study has found.

The report by academics at De Montfort University in Leicester said ‘significant barriers’ existed to information exchange across EU borders.

These included differing definitions of sex attackers and violent thugs and ‘problematic’ access to conviction data.

Campaigners will seize on the research as evidence that Britain can regain control of its borders only by quitting the EU.
