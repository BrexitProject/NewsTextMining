Do we cave in because we’re too scared to leave? Or do we vote to retrieve our sovereignty, walk away from the whole racket and engage with the world on our own terms?

As David Cameron rightly says, the British way is to fight, rather than quit. Given the EU has proved that it is structurally incapable of reform, we now have a choice, writes The Spectator

A vote to leave would represent an extraordinary vote of confidence in the project of the United Kingdom and the principle of national self-determination. It would also show reform-minded Europeans that theirs is not a lost cause. And that we stand willing to help forge a Europe based on freedom, co-operation and sovereignty.

The value of sovereignty cannot be measured by any economist’s formula.

Adam Smith, the father of economics, first observed that the prosperity of a country is decided by whether it keeps its ‘laws and institutions’ healthy. This basic insight explains why nations thrive or fail, and has been the great secret of British success: intellectual, artistic, scientific and industrial.

The principles of the Magna Carta and achievements of the Glorious Revolution led to our emergence as a world power. To pass up the chance to stop our laws being over-ridden by Luxembourg and our democracy eroded by Brussels would be a derogation of duty to this generation and the next.

No one — economist, politician or mystic — knows what tumult we can expect in the next 15 years. But we do know that, whatever happens, Britain will be better able to respond and adapt as a sovereign country living under its own laws.

The history of the past two centuries can be summed up in two words: democracy matters.
