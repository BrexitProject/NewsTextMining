The Sunday Times came out in favour of a vote to leave – a day after its weekday sibling backed the remain case. In an editorial, the paper called for a “looser, more flexibile” association with the EU. It said that while better diplomacy might have rendered the referendum unnecessary, now that the question was being put to the electorate, voting to leave was the best way to stop increasing political and economic union.

Criticising the EU’s economic recovery since the recession, and its impact on British sovereignty and security, the paper said: “In the event of Brexit, Brussels may pursue a ‘global security strategy’, perhaps including an EU army without a UK veto.

“We must keep out. It is Nato that guarantees our security.”

The Sunday Telegraph came out in favour of Brexit in its editorial. “On balance … we believe the leave campaign has articulated an ambitious vision for Britain as an independent nation, once again free to make its own decisions. Remain, by contrast, has resorted to grim pessimism.”

The newspaper accused the chancellor, George Osborne, of making “unconscionable threats” over pensions and “dire predictions” on trade agreements that, with other issues, amount to an “unremitting tide of gloom”.

Declaring that the EU “belongs to the past”, it said: “Leaving the EU does not mean leaving Europe. A vote for Brexit on Thursday will not change our geography.”
