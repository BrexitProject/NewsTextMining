His Shadow Cabinet colleague John Cryer, who chairs the Parliamentary Labour party group of MPs, risked facing the sack after he defied his leader by declaring: 'The EU is not Europe but a political construct imposed on many countries.'

He said he is voting for Britain to leave the EU in next week's referendum, becoming the tenth Labour MP to join the Brexit campaign.

Mr Cryer hit out at the EU for 'undermining democratic governments, weakening national boundaries and handing power to the markets and the corporate world'.
