For me it is time to take a leap of faith, it is very rare for a people to hold their own destiny in their own hands and I believe we must take advantage of that and vote to leave.Unfortunately I believe a lot of people are voting for the wrong reasons such as immigration and there has been a real lack of factual information coming out from either side to describe what the EU is and how it operates. The fact is the reason so many business leaders want Remain is because the EU is fast becoming a corporate oligarch, it is a huge tax haven and far from supporting the common worker it actually continues to increase the divide between us the people and those with wealth and control. We must bring democracy and power back to a base where we can control it.
