Bosses of 100 small and medium-sized firms have signed a letter urging voters to back Brexit.

They say they are held back by EU red tape. Traders who signed the letter, published by The Sun, range from shopkeepers to butchers and interior designers. They argue the ‘ideals of the EU are no longer in the best interests of British business or the British people’.

The letter states: ‘We run some of the five million small businesses that form the backbone of this country. We believe Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and the Brexit camp are right that we must vote to leave the EU on June 23. When we voted to join Europe in 1975 it was on the basis that the EEC was a trading agreement. Today’s EU is no longer just a trading agreement. It is a project aimed at creating a massive political and economic union. We believe many of the ideals of the EU are not in the best interests of British business or the British people.’

The traders add: ‘Small and medium-sized businesses are constantly held back by unnecessary EU regulations and red tape. We need the freedom to be able to thrive in the 21st century, to trade with other emerging nations and to create jobs for people in our local areas.’

One of the signatories, Catherine Stanley, 41, of Pinnacle Arts and Crafts in Plymouth, Devon, said: ‘I believe it would be easier for people to flourish without all the EU red tape.’
