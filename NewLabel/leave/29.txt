On the campaign trial in East Anglia yesterday in which he gutted a salmon during a visit to a food company in Lowestoft, the former London mayor described the idea as a 'fantastical proposition'.

He added: 'If it were to appear I would certainly not support it, I would oppose it but I don't think it will.' In a joint letter yesterday, former Tory leaders Lord Howard and Mr Duncan Smith joined former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont in criticising the Bank of England and the Treasury for presenting one-sided forecasts about the impact of Brexit.

The joint letter said Mr Carney was guilty of 'startling dishonesty'

They wrote: 'There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis. They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain.'
