Labour MP and Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart said a vote for Leave was not about dividing people but renewing the country’s democracy. In a statement on Facebook she writes that she too is determined to “eliminate extremism” but that this should not lead to the closing down of genuine debate.

She writes: “We have to be scrupulous about how we treat each other. Politicians and voters must reflect on the hate-filled language that too often scars our debates and passes for discussion on social media. Short of this bile, we must take care before assuming that anger turned up to maximum volume should be the default way to hold a political discussion. It is a difficult balance to strike and we must be wary of retreating to the blandness and consensus that serve only to blur the outlines of the issues.

“For some time now voters have felt that there is little to choose between the parties. Since 1997, politicians have been tussling over the centre ground with often only nuances … to tell us apart. As someone put it to me: ‘There’s little change in the menu; they’re just arguing over who will be the cook.’ This referendum could not be more different.”

Stuart, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, adds: “For me, the underlying question is clear: are the people able to choose the governments that make their laws and to throw them out when they fail? I believe leaving the EU is the way to safeguard this precious right. At the same time, I respect those who take an opposing view.
