But Boris Johnson yesterday accused the PM of using Government contracts and the promise of honours to persuade business leaders to back his campaign to keep Britain in the EU.

Mr Johnson said Eurosceptic business leaders were being ‘leaned on’ to keep their views quiet, while waverers were being tempted with the offer of rewards.

Speaking to LBC Radio, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t tell you the pressure that Project Fear and Remain put on senior business people not to articulate their views. Everyone has an interest in keeping friendly with government.’

Asked about the kind of pressure Downing Street was exerting, Mr Johnson replied: ‘I do not wish in anyway to be disparaging or critical of my friends in Government.

“But it is well-known that there is an operation in Downing Street and you will get a call from certain gentlemen, whose names you can discover.

‘And they will say, “look, you know, we want to continue to have contracts with you. It’s very important that we want to continue friendly relationships, there is an honours system as you know”, all this kind of thing. And that’s how it is. There is a bit of leaning on.’

Earlier this month, Mr Cameron was accused of ‘borderline corruption’ after using the Queen’s birthday honours to shower gongs on business leaders and luvvies who backed his campaign to keep Britain in the EU.
