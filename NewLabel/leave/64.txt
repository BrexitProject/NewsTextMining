Voting for Brexit would 'neutralise' extremists who try to exploit people's fears over mass immigration, Boris Johnson has insisted.

The former London mayor spoke out as supporters of cutting ties with Brussels condemned a controversial Ukip referendum poster.

And speaking at a rally in London today, Mr Johnson argued that leaving the EU would help silence those who 'play politics' with immigration.Â 

'I'm not only pro-immigration, I'm pro-immigrants,' he said.

'And I am in favour of an amnesty of illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in society.

'I'll tell you why. Because it is the humane thing to do. It is the economically rational thing to do.

'And it means taking back control of a system that is at the moment completely out of control.

'If we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style points based system, we'll be dealing fairly and justly with every part of the world and we will be neutralising people in this country and across Europe who wish to play politics with immigration and who are opposed to immigrants.

'That is the way forward. To neutralise the extremists.'

Mr Johnson, who was celebrating his birthday today, was address an audience of a few hundred people alongside Mr Gove and employment minister Priti Patel and Labour's Kate Hoey.

Mr Gove said leaving the EU will not just be a 'vote of confidence' for Britain but will show solidarity with those in struggling economies such as Greece, Spain and Portugal who, he claimed, have suffered because of the EU.

He said: 'The people who lead the European Union have never said sorry, never apologised, never admitted that they've got anything wrong.
