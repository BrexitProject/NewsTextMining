Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Eurosceptic Tory MP, said: ‘Car manufacturers are doing much better outside of the single market. 

'They are refusing to see this and are just drinking their own bathwater. It’s good to see that Aston Martin is being more phlegmatic – much like James Bond would be.’ 

The Leave camp argues firms such as Germany’s BMW and Volkswagen and French car maker Peugeot are so reliant on the UK market that they will rush to strike a free trade agreement with Britain.

They also point out that sales outside the EU are growing faster to rapidly growing countries such as China and India than within the struggling single market. 

A record number of cars – 77.3 per cent of total production – were exported, with 1,227,881 vehicles leaving the UK. Demand from the EU grew 11.3 per cent, with 57.5 per cent of cars sold to the continent.

But sales of British-made cars to countries outside the EU are growing more rapidly, with demand from the US rising by 26.5 per cent.
