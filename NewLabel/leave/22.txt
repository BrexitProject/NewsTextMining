Leave campaigner Priti Patel says the pressure on schools shows how uncontrolled immigration is affecting public services

Tens of thousands of pupils are being squeezed into extra primary school classes amid high migration and a baby boom.

Schools are being forced to provide ‘bulge’ classes or permanently increase intakes due to the unprecedented pressure on places.

Data issued under freedom of information laws shows that in 47 English council areas, more than 732 primary schools have added an extra or bulge class in the past five years.

These one-off classes equate to an extra 21,960 pupils on school rolls. They usually start in reception and continue through the years until the pupils reach secondary age.

Another 418 primary schools have permanently increased their admission total to add one or more additional forms.

If the pattern is repeated across England, it would mean a total of 2,432 bulge classes, cramming more than 72,960 extra pupils into schools. It would also equate to 1,368 primaries being forced to permanently add forms.

Leave campaigner and Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘The shortage of places is another example of how uncontrolled migration is putting unsustainable pressures on public services.’

Schools minister Nick Gibb warned against a Leave vote, saying: ‘By building a stronger economy, we will deliver 600,000 more places over the next five years.’
