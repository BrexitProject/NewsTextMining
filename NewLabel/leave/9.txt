So when asked about how they would vote in this Thursday’s EU referendum, and whether they would do so, they were initially thrown. “Woooaaahh,” a young man shouted as he turned to his friends. All then joined in a louder, soaring cry and burst into laughter before, one after another, declaring themselves for Brexit. The loudest, a young man who claimed he was called Paul but who his mates insisted was Mike, said Nigel Farage was a “good bloke” who spoke sense.

Paul/Mike said he had listened to the arguments on both sides, thought “a lot of lies have been said”, and had decided for himself. “I have an eye on the pros and cons. We have the best engineers in this country. The Japanese will still want to buy from us whether we are in or out won’t they? I’m voting for out.”

Ciara McCrory, a 19-year-old healthcare adviser, said she had been following the debate closely. “My dad is a taxi driver. He says there would be more work if it weren’t for immigration and all the Polish people. So I will vote to leave.” But walking down the road behind her, Ian Farrimond and his wife, Lindsay, who are missionaries, said there was no question that the country would be stronger inside the EU. “I just have a strong gut feeling we are safer and better off in. But I don’t have any confidence about the result. It really terrifies me,” said Lindsay.
