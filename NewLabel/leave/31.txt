More than 100,000 students a year from outside Europe are failing to go home after finishing their courses, a report reveals.

Between 2010 and 2013 the influx of non-EU students averaged 156,000 a year, the report published by think-tank MigrationWatch, based on Office for National Statistics figures, showed. But between 2012 and 2015, when they would have been expected to graduate, an average of 46,000 a year left – an annual difference of 110,000.

Some will take legitimate jobs, be given permission to settle here with a partner or pursue further studies. But tens of thousands exploit a lax visa system to stay unlawfully.

Wolfgang Schäuble, the powerful German finance minister, said he sympathised with British voters who want to leave the European Union and its 'self- regarding' leadership that has gone 'too far' and lost touch with voters across the continent.
