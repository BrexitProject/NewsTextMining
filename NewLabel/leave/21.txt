Economists For Brexit analysed the total taxation contribution of the 1.2million EU migrants in the UK considered unskilled and compared it with the cost in welfare payments and use of the NHS and education. 

It calculated that a family of four EU migrants, with two children at primary school and a stay-at-home mother, would pay £1,271 in tax and national insurance a year, but cost £30,496 in handouts, schools and healthcare – a net cost of £29,225.

Meanwhile, a single EU foreigner would rake in £2,120 a year in benefits but pay out £1,271 – a net cost of £849 per annum.

The think-tank, assisted by former University of Liverpool tax and benefits expert Paul Ashton, calculated single people would make up 28 per cent of the 1.2million unskilled migrants.

This gave the cost of single migrants as £288.6million, while for families it was £6.28billion – a total of almost £6.6billion. The cost to the taxpayer was £17.75 a month for each worker, or £213 a year. Patrick Minford, co-chairman of the think-tank and a professor of economics at Cardiff University, said: ‘Skilled migrants offer a huge economic boost to the UK... 

'However, it is clear that the UK is suffering in economic terms significantly from vast numbers of unskilled EU migrants. Leaving the EU and the single market is the only way for the UK to take back control.’
