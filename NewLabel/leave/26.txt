The intervention, with just two days left to go until the polls open, came as a former aide claimed that Mr Cameron was told four years ago his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain is in the EU.

Steve Hilton, the PM's ex-policy guru, said Whitehall officials had given the warning during meetings in 2012.

The civil servants said 'directly and explicitly' that the net migration goal was not deliverable given EU freedom of movement rules.

Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Hilton recalls the warning to Mr Cameron, saying: 'We were told, directly and explicitly, that it was impossible for the Government to meet its immigration target as long as we remained members of the EU, which of course insists on the free movement of people within it.'Â
