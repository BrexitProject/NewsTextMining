David Cameron was told four years ago his immigration target was 'impossible' while Britain is in the EU – but continued to make the promise.

The claim is made today by the Prime Minister's ex-closest aide Steve Hilton, who attended the meetings with senior Whitehall officials in 2012.

He reveals Mr Cameron was warned 'directly and explicitly' by civil servants that his 'tens of thousands' net migration goal was not deliverable given EU freedom of movement rules.

Despite this, the Prime Minister has repeatedly restated his ambition to hit the target – even including it in his 2015 general election manifesto. At no stage has he succeeded in cutting net migration to below 100,000.

Mr Cameron denied the claims today and insisted that when Mr Hilton left government in 2012 immigration was falling and was close to the target.
