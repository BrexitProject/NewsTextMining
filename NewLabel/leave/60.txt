Michael Gove (pictured) has urged the public not to 'flinch' or let down future generations whose lives would be diminished by Brussels

'We have got to have confidence in our institutions. Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy. It gave the world common law traditions, trial by jury and the principle of innocent until proven guilty.

'We gave the world moral leadership in the fight against slavery and the fight against fascism.

'We gave the world the NHS and public service broadcasting and we did all these things as a self-governing democracy.

'So the idea that Britain is a rain soaked little island where we eat too much cake – that is just not right. Voting to leave is a rejection of pessimism and an embrace of optimism.'

Speaking on a final campaign visit to Dorset, Mr Gove said this was Britain's opportunity to 'break free'. He continued: 'If we do not vote to leave tomorrow, then we won't get the chance to escape the EU for another generation and possibly in our lifetime.

'And if we vote to stay, the European elites will take that as a vote of confidence in their leadership and a vote for more Europe.

'More of the same surrender of powers, more of the same lack of control over our money, more of the same lack of democracy.

'I just think it would be difficult to explain to our children and grandchildren that when we had the opportunity to show confidence in our democracy, that we decided to flinch at the last moment.'
