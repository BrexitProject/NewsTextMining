Pro-Brexit Tory MP Sir Bill Cash has attacked the IMF and its boss Lagarde who he claims is a 'stooge' for Osborne

Another Eurosceptic, Ukip MP Douglas Carswell, said: ‘The inconsistencies in the IMF’s own report show that they’re telling us what they want us to do – not what will actually happen. Its report confirms the eurozone’s economy is a basket case and yet they insist that we should remain part of it.’ Under its ‘adverse scenario’, the IMF forecasts economic growth will slow from 1.9 per cent if Britain stays in the EU to 1.1 per cent.

The economy will deteriorate more rapidly next year, with GDP shrinking by 0.8 per cent before growing by just 0.6 per cent in 2018 and 1.7 per cent in 2019. If the public vote Remain, the IMF forecasts growth of 2.2 per cent next year, 2.2 per cent in 2018 and 2.1 per cent in 2019.

The watchdog also predicts the jobless rate could rise from its record low of 5 per cent to 5.2 this year, 6 per cent next year and 6.5 in 2018. This would equate to throwing 500,000 people out of work.
