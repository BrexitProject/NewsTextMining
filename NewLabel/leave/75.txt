In his final newspaper column before the vote, the ex-Mayor of London wrote in the Daily Telegraph: 'When you pick up your ballot paper this Thursday, you have it in your hands to transform Britain's current democratic arrangements for the better.

'You can change the whole course of European history – and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive. 



'If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going a direction we don't want to go.'
