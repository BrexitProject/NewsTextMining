But, speaking before the suspension of campaigning yesterday, Mr Johnson hit back: 'We're obviously going to be hearing Project Fear moving into its final fusillade.

'It has failed to make much of an impact because everyone can remember what the PM said only a few months ago when he said Britain would do very well outside of the EU. The pound is roughly where it has been. It is no lower today than it has been in the last few months.

'I seem to remember the pound fell sharply on the day when I said I was going to support the Leave campaign but we have just seen record employment figures and British exports are doing well.

'We shouldn't be talking this country down. It's a great country and a great economy. I think it will flourish outside the EU.'

In a further attack on the economic credibility of the Remain camp, Mr Johnson joined the 66 Conservative MPs who have attacked George Osborne's threat of a 'punishment Budget'.
