George Osborne last night suggested that workers could start losing their jobs as soon as Friday morning if Britain votes for Brexit on Thursday.

In an extraordinary escalation of the scaremongering, the Chancellor warned that people could begin losing their jobs ‘very quickly’ as a result of the ‘economic shock’.

Ramping up Project Fear over the economy, he also refused to rule out suspending trading on the London stock market if Britons voted to leave the EU.

Fear factor: George Osborne at McLaren. He suggested that workers could start losing their jobs as soon as Friday morning if Britain votes for Brexit on Thursday

Asked in an LBC radio interview about whether redundancies warned of by banks such as JP Morgan could come as early as Friday, Mr Osborne said: ‘That will start to happen very quickly, sadly.’

He then warned of a flight of money out of the UK if Britons vote to leave.

He said: ‘On Friday morning you will see the first reaction in the financial markets because they’ve placed all these bets that they will move money out of Britain if Britain votes to Leave.’
