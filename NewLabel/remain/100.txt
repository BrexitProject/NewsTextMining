American motor giant Ford claimed in a memo to its 14,000 UK staff that remaining in the EU would help create an ‘even stronger business and create a more secure future’ for employees.

Bosses of Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota, BMW and Vauxhall also said Brexit would put jobs and investment at risk.

Ford warned Britain could lose access to free trade deals, and that hefty tariffs of up to 10 per cent could be imposed on imported vehicles and 2.7 per cent on exports.

Ford said: ‘This would significantly impact our business. The time taken to renegotiate trade agreements with the EU and other countries also risks leading to a prolonged period of uncertainty.’

The car industry has been one of Britain’s brightest success stories since the financial crisis, supporting 800,000 jobs in the UK and contributing £15.5billion to the economy.

Trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders added that the strong British car industry could be jeopardised if the public votes to leave the EU.

The Remain campaign is hoping that the dire warnings from some of the biggest car manufacturers will unnerve voters ahead of the referendum.
