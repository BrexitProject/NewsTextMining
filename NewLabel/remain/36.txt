A UK that votes leave is not the UK that I have made my home over the past 26 years. Voting leave is tantamount to saying: “I’m happy to risk destabilising the longest period of peace Europe has known.” It means weakening Europe, and the world, to the threat posed by Putin and by terrorists. I have never felt less welcome here and more frightened. Voting leave is not a mistake that can be undone at the next general election. It is a decision that will have a potentially devastating impact for generations to come. But most of all, voting leave will mean leaving a piece of humanity

Like many others I share the sentiments of Franklin Medhurst (Report, 17 June) and his understanding about Britain’s relationship with our neighbours across the Channel. We must absolutely not go back to a Europe of competing nations and empires but should maintain that essential forum of the EU to resolve any differences, for all its current shortcomings. Reading the press and talking to people, there is a clear view that older citizens will vote to leave the EU. Well, I’m 78 years old and will be voting to remain both for the reasons that Mr Medhurst so passionately argued and because the future of this country is not for the elderly but for the young to decide, and most of the young citizens I have talked to have been in favour of remaining. They feel both British and European, as I do.
