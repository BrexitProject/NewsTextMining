Beckham reflected on his days at Old Trafford, arguing that his team had been helped by a Danish goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, the leadership of an Irishman, Roy Keane, and the skill of France’s Eric Cantona.

Beckham spoke of how welcome he had been in other European countries, adding: “We live in a vibrant and connected world where together as a people we are strong. For our children and their children, we should be facing the problems of the world together and not alone.

“For these reasons I am voting to remain.”

Ferdinand wrote an article in the Evening Standard saying he was motivated to vote for the first time.

“It’s about the sort of country our kids are going to grow up in and how the rest of the world will look at Britain from now on. And from all I’ve heard I think the decision we make could take us to very different places,” he said.

“I’ve got a unique perspective on this. I’ve seen racism in football and I’ve spoken out about the racism my family and I experienced. But in this campaign, to tell you the truth, I haven’t liked what I’ve seen. I think the focus on immigration has been a shame. I think there’s a danger that, if leave wins, it’ll be an endorsement of the idea that it’s OK to blame all our problems on foreigners,” he wrote.
