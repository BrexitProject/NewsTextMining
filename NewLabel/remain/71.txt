I wanted to ask you to please go and vote, and to vote for Britain to remain in the EU. Not because of 1% or 2% of GDP growth. Not because of the value of the pound. Not because Britain, like Switzerland or Norway, would have to accept European legislation without being part of the drafting process. Although you should look into these issues carefully, of course.

No, I ask you to vote “in” because I love Europe and the EU, and want Britain to be part of it. Europe is about openness, about meeting people easily, and living and working with them. I am German, and spent a term at a British boarding school as an exchange student. My wife is French, and our children were born in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Moving through Europe was easy, we always felt at home. Compare that to the old days of visas, work permits and resentments. We have come a long way.

Putting Britain’s interests first sounds like a reasonable enough idea. But what if the French go for “France d’abord”, Germans claim “Deutschland zuerst”? And what if these “us first” claims contradict one another, and we do not have an EU to help us work out our differences? We’ve been there before. And we do not want to be there again. Never.

Who would be applauding if Britain were to leave the EU? Putin would be laughing. Beijing would be gleeful. And all the other my-country-comes-first guys: Marine Le Pen, Strache of Austria, the ugly German AfD party, Farage. Imagining what Europe would look like gives me the creeps. So please, vote for Britain to stay in, help to make Europe better. With love,
