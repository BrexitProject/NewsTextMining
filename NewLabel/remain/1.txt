I will be voting remain. When I think of what came before the EU in terms of the divisions and fighting in Europe I feel there is strength in unity. The UK has spent so much of the past trying to distance itself from daring to be called ‘European’ just because a small body of water separates us from the continent. It’s the 21st century and we need to work on how we can help each other and the world. If we leave, and Russia continues with the current campaign of aggression it’s been showing I would feel safer as part of the EU than to be left alone.

As well as this, the economic benefits of being in the EU as well as the other milestones (paid holidays, workers’ rights etc) that it has provided for us cannot be denied.

The vicious, hateful and downright untrue rhetoric that has been spouted by the Leave campaign has sown seeds that shouldn’t have been planted in people’s minds.
