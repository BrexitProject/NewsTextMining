Using immigration as a “sticking plaster” is not just bad for the UK economy, he says, but for other EU countries too. “I know from being in Poland, when a lot of the Poles first came over in 2004 it left their hospitals short … We have got to look at the consequences, what do we do to these poorer countries? So Poland has a shocking lack of teachers, doctors, nurses. Is that good for us as the world’s fifth nation to rape and pillage other countries?”

Winfield does not see that as a reason to leave. He retorts: “So to take that analogy, we are getting off on our life boat now and we are in our big ocean and we are looking for a safe port and we are looking for safe harbour. By that definition our economic life is in somebody else’s hands.”
