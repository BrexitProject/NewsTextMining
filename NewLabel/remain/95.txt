The premier said a vote to leave on Thursday would be 'irreversible'. 'I know I haven't got everything right... but of this I am convinced... Britain is better off inside the EU than out on our own.' 

'The next generation will have to live with the consequences far longer than the rest of us.'

On Thursday 'it will just be you in that polling booth', he said, 'taking a decision that will affect your future, your children's future, your grandchildren's future'.

He added: 'Our economic security is paramount. It will be stronger if we stay; if we leave we will put it at risk.

'That is a risk to jobs, a risk to families, a risk to our children's future and there is no going back.'
