If we vote to leave the EU our health and social care systems will be in chaos. We cannot recruit enough staff now.

I work for a small organisation. Across 10 or 11 services we have many vacancies, including nurses, carers, cooks, housekeepers and laundry staff. A points-based system would exclude all except the nurses. We need to encourage immigration; the vast majority of people from Europe come here to work. The British people complaining about the number of people coming to the UK do not want these jobs.

If we leave the EU, family members are going to have to look after their next of kin at home because we will not be able to staff our hospitals, nursing and care homes.
