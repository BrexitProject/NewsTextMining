'I don't want to have anyone else as Prime Minister other than David Cameron and if people spend their time thinking about some of this stuff then they are getting in the way of two things: one a fair, open, fact-based referendum debate; and two, the Conservative government continuing afterwards in a stable and secure fashion.' 

In his own return to campaigning today, Mr Cameron warned the economy 'hangs in the balance' on Thursday.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Prime Minister said: 'If you're not sure, don't take the risk of leaving... If you don't know, don't go.'

He added: 'If we choose to go out of the EU, we will go out – with all of the consequences that will have for everyone in Britain.

Prime Minister David Cameron resumed campaigning activities today, two days after an extraordinary joint appearance with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Birstall, Yorkshire, pictured. Mr Cameron warned the economy 'hangs in the balance' on Thursday 

'If we were to leave and it quickly turned out to be a big mistake, there wouldn't be a way of changing our minds and having another go.'

The Sunday Times today said senior Conservatives were planning on how to deal with the aftermath of the referendum 'if everything goes wrong'.
