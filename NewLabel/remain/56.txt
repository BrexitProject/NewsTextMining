On behalf of my generation I offer a heartfelt apology: to my children, their children and all the young. It is my generation, caught up in prejudice and unable to see beyond their small and insular horizon, that voted with their feet. It is my generation which, looking backwards at some mythical past, has decided to stop; to remain not in Europe but in time. Whatever the motives of my contemporaries in voting out, they have condemned our children to a narrower and greyer future.Â A future, as the bard said, more bound in shallows and in miseries. A future which will be directed by a more rightwing and protectionist governance. A future that will look after those who have, and will care much less for the voices of those who have not. This is not so much goodbye Europe as farewell Great Britain, hello little England.
