“Now we know that leaving the EU will also mean leaving the single market. For Gibraltar, that means the difference between a market of 32,000 people and a market of 520 million people.”

On those terms, he said, Brexit represented an existential threat to the territory’s economy. “It would require more than a repositioning,” Picardo said. “It would require a whole new economic model. That’s why so many here – barring perhaps a few individuals – will vote remain.”

But Brexit poses another threat to Gibraltar. Spain, which has wanted the territory back under its control pretty much since the Rock was first ceded to Britain in 1713, could make life considerably more difficult for Gibraltarians if British voters choose to leave the EU on 23 June.
