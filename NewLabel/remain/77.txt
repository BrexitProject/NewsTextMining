Forgetting for the moment the non-economic problems with the EU – such as the democratic deficit and the collapse of Schengen – and the current catastrophic economic failure of the euro project, we should look to the economic future of the EU. This is an institution with a rapidly declining share of global trade which continues to pass damaging regulations at the expense of small innovative companies that should be the engine of future growth. Notwithstanding our position that the UK economy will perform significantly better outside the EU, recent CBI data shows that UK companies’ investment plans to raise output have increased during the Brexit debate and are higher than a year ago. Contrary to the consensus scaremongering, the UK will be far better off outside the EU both in the short and long-term.
