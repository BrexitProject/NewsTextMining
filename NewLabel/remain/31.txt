A vote to quit the European Union would have many consequences for the UK, some more apparent than others. George Osborne argues that life after Brexit would be characterised by market turmoil and a shock to the government’s finances that will force ministers to impose even more austerity. Here we look at what business groups, analysts and economic forecasters have said will be the effect on the economic landscape should the UK vote to leave.

According to one forecast, the pound will sink by up to 30%. Most forecasters have plumped for 18% to 20%, but Ian Harnett, the chief investment strategist at Absolute Strategy Research, who is a former chief European strategist at the investment bank UBS, believes the dangers of leaving the EU are even greater than many imagine. He says markets are complacent and that the 12% fall in the pound’s value against the dollar since last November is a mere taster for a bigger tumble. For businesses and consumers, that means the recent trend for fuel prices to tick higher will accelerate.

Foreign holidays will be more expensive. Britain’s reliance on imported food will also increase costs for food manufacturers and the consumer. The Remain camp, using a conservative 12% decline in sterling as their measure, calculate each household will be £220 a year worse off as the buying power of a weaker pound increases the cost of foreign goods.
