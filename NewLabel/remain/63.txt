As many of our British friends are considering leaving, I draw your attention to a fresh perspective on the EU experiment. Ian Morris, a distinguished (British) professor of history, has written a provocative book – War, what is it good for? – supporting the argument that war, and the subsequent need for government to make conquest profitable, has over millennia driven violence down and made life safer and more prosperous. He posits that the EU presents a new way: “A truly astonishing thing is happening. For the first time in history, huge numbers of people – 500 million so far – are coming together to form a bigger, safer, richer society without being forced to do so. It has been an epochal transformation, albeit a quiet one. Dullness was the whole point of the EC … western Europe now turned history’s most successful formula around and bound its members together in an economic unit and then began using economics to create a political unit ... This is simultaneously the dullest and the most daring trick that statesmen had ever attempted.”

I challenge my fellow British Europeans to keep supporting this daring endeavour. Be wary of nostalgia weaving a web of misty memories of the “good old days” that were never that good when you were living them. Europe needs the courage, steadfast endurance, and the critical voice of the British to pull this off.
