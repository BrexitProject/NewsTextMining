Osborne stood his ground on Wednesday, however, insisting there would be no choice but to make extremely tough spending decisions to protect the economy.Cameron backed him and the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, at prime minister’s questions, saying the financial shock of leaving the EU must not be ignored. “Nobody wants to have an emergency budget. Nobody wants to have cuts in public services. Nobody wants to have tax increases,” he said. “But I would say this. There is only one thing worse than not addressing a crisis in your public finances through a budget, and that is ignoring it.”

The spotlight will switch back to Labour on Thursday, with Gordon Brown and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, appearing together in Manchester to make the argument that northern Britain could be entitled to more EU funding if it votes to remain next week. Separately, Labour local council leaders will argue that poorer areas would be hardest hit by the economic shock in the event of Brexit.

Brown will warn that leaving the EU could put Britain’s great cities at risk of industrial decline last seen in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher. The Labour former prime minister will say the UK’s 10 biggest cities outside London would see their economies threatened by leaving the EU, which has poured funding into areas that the Tories turned “from industrial heartlands into industrial wastelands”.
