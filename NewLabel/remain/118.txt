Last night, the Remain camp released statements from Mr Cameron and Britain's three surviving former prime ministers urging the country to vote In.

Mr Cameron said: 'Today we have assembled the biggest coalition of support in history – from businesses, to trade unions to expert economists and across political parties – for a vote to remain. Quitting Europe is a risk to your family's future because a vote to leave on Thursday means there is no going back on Friday.'

In what was described as an 'unprecedented alliance', the Prime Minister was backed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from the Labour side. Mr Blair said: 'Britain faces a historic choice between prosperity, influence and security as part of Europe, or a reckless leap in the dark and years of damaging uncertainty. If we vote to leave, there is no going back. Voting Remain will secure Britain's place as a proud, influential country with a strong economy and a bright future.



Appearing alongside Mr Cameron in Bristol, Sir John Major said the Brexit camp were 'the gravediggers of our prosperity'.
