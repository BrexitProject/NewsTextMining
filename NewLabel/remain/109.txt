J.K Rowling: Why I am backing the Remain campaign and will defend the European Union which has fostered 'peace and unity'

The writer posted a series of tweets and retweets celebrating the EU’s role in fostering peace and unity

Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has leapt to the defence of the European Union on Twitter.

The writer posted a series of tweets and retweets celebrating the EU’s role in fostering peace and unity.

The bestselling author, who is urging her 7 million followers to back Remain, has been using her online presence to highlight her views.

Last week Rowling tweeted: ‘I don’t want to leave a union that has brought more peace and stability to the region.’ The writer, who was born in Scotland, later referred to the threat of Scotland holding a second independence referendum if the UK voted to leave the EU, reposting: ‘Just so we are all clear, this may well decide the fate of two unions, not one.’

The mother of three has also been quick to condemn those she believes are stoking up racial tensions for their own political ends.

Even before the brutal murder of Labour MP Jo Cox, Rowling had posted a series of messages criticising the anti-immigration camp. She tweeted: ‘Those people shame their cause and the country they claim to care about.’

She also retweeted a message which accused Brexit-supporting newspapers of immigrant-baiting.

In a tweet posted on June 15, she highlighted research which showed the British public tended to be misinformed about statistics concerning the EU.

And Rowling has expressed her concerns over campaigners in the Brexit camp dismissing the economic warnings of respected bodies including the Bank of England and the Institute For Fiscal Studies.

She said: ‘The only thing scarier than people who are anti-knowledge, anti-facts and anti-experts are the ones who boast of it.’
