It accused Brexit campaigners of peddling a “dangerous illusion”.

“The human head knows that, especially in the world we now inhabit, our deepest desires must somehow be moderated to suit the increasingly tough reality of a competitive world in which, though still a great nation, we no longer have the power or the wealth which once allowed us to live in splendid isolation,” it said.

It attacked the “single-minded leaders” of the leave campaign. “So eager are they for a divorce that they are prepared to sacrifice a large chunk of our income, and trade down on living conditions, in order to walk out into a rose-tinted future of ‘freedom’. Though it is interesting that they have been careful to make no such a declaration.”

The Observer also published an editorial in favour of remaining in the EU.

The newspaper said voters should not turn their backs on the European project in an article headlined: “For an international, liberal and open Britain, we need to be part of the EU.”

Affirming that the paper has “always been proud of its internationalist, liberal worldview”, it said: “Despite its many flaws, this paper believes the EU has, without question, been a force for good.

“Remaining in the EU will not magically eliminate the challenges Britain faces in the years to come. But if we choose to do so, it will keep Britain at the heart of reforming the European project so that the nations of Europe are together better equipped to face them.”
