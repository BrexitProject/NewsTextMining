If Brexit is the result, that freshly acquired 4% would be removed in a flash, one assumes. Then one might add the same fall again – or probably more – to reflect the fact of a leave victory. Suddenly, sterling at $1.30, versus $1.47 currently, almost becomes a par score after a Brexit vote.

The great speculator George Soros, writing in this paper, reckons the drop would be steeper, to below $1.15. That may sound alarmist, but who can say he is wrong? Even Capital Economics, which argues that talk of Brexit triggering recession in the UK is overdone, thinks a vote for leave could push sterling to $1.20.
