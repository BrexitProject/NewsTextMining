The strongly pro-EU former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said there will be 'very big consequences' after the country voted to leave the European Union

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has said there will be 'very big consequences' after the country voted to leave the European Union.

Mr Blair said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world' and hit out at Jeremy Corbyn's lacklustre leadership of the party during the campaigning months.

'We've got to consider what our purpose is, where we are going and what we are trying to do here.' 

In an interview with Sky News, he said: 'The answers to the challenges of globalisation do not lie in shutting ourselves off from the world.

'And I think what we will learn in these days, weeks and months ahead, I'm afraid, is that you can ride the anger through these populist movements but you don't actually produce the answers to the challenges people face... We will find that what people thought was going to be an answer to these problems is not an answer at all.'
