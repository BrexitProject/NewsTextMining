Quitting the European Union will not stem immigration and risks creating a broken Britain, he insisted.

Leaving would be a 'disproportionate' response to migration concerns and the country would live to regret it for a 'long time to come'. 

He said: 'If our nation does vote to leave, we must respect their decision, but if they vote to leave on the basis of half-truths and untruths and misunderstandings, then pretty soon the grave-diggers of our prosperity will have some very serious questions to answer.'

'They will have to account for what they have said and done but that will be of little consolation for we will be out, out for good, diminished as an influence on the world. 

'A truly Great Britain shrunk down to a little England perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales, and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south by the border the controls that would then be the edge of the European Union.'

Dismissing accusations that the Remain campaign had been 'project fear', he insisted that Mr Cameron had a 'duty' to to warn the nation of the dangers of quitting.
