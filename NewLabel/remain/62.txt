The most valuable and important thing about the EU is that, for all its faults, it is the pinnacle of human social achievement. Never before in history have so many nations cooperated at such a high level. Cooperation is difficult and frustrating, but it works. It works because everyone benefits – it is a positive-sum game. Humans are super-cooperators. We are brilliant at it, and it is undoubtedly the main reason for our extraordinary success as a species. However, we still have a way to go before we cooperate well at a global level. The EU is the first example in history when countries have voluntarily agreed to cooperate at such a high level. It is difficult and there have been setbacks, but we should not give up on it. If we do, it will set back progress towards global cooperation, which is essential for protecting our planet and giving everyone a decent life. The British are key contributors towards building an EU that works. If we walk away we will damage it, perhaps fatally, and set back human progress, possibly for many years. That would be a sad end to a proud history.
