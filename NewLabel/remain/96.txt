Billionaire George Soros today forecast a 'black Friday' in the markets if Britain votes for Brexit in Thursday's referendum on EU membership 

A new economic warning was issued today by the billionaire who famously bet against the pound and won in the 1992 crash, who said a Brexit vote on Thursday could produce a 'Black Friday' as markets react in horror to instability caused by the result.

George Soros forced then prime minister John Major to pull Britain out of the 'European Exchange Rate Mechanism' in 1992, sparking chaos in the markets on a day that went down in history as 'Black Wednesday'.

David Cameron and George Osborne were mocked after suggesting Brexit would trigger a 'DIY recession' for the first time in British history 

Mr Soros today claimed the collapse in the value of the pound on Friday could be even bigger if Britain votes for Brexit and he warned it would leave people poorer.
