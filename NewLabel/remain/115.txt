People are already holding off on buying homes and cars because of fears over a Brexit vote, the Bank of England has warned.

The Bank said 'major economic decisions' were increasingly being put on hold ahead of the crucial referendum next week.Â 

Policy makers also said it was 'increasingly probable' that the value of the Pound will slump if we vote for Brexit.

The assessment - in the latest minutes of the Monetary Policy committee - came as the Bank's governor Mark Carney insisted he has every right to comment on the economic impact of Brexit.
