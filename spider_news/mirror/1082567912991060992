Lindsay Lohan gets involved in EU referendum - and SNP MP responds with Mean Girls quote

2016-06-24

 Lindsay Lohan has waded into the EU debate. 

 The Mean Girls actress posted a video on her Instagram account shortly after it was revealed Sunderland had voted to leave the EU. 

Leave won more than 61% of the vote in the northern city.

Shortly after, Lindsay, who is backing the 'In' campaign, posted a bizarre video of her and a few pals as they sat around watching the news on TV.

It starts with a close-up shot of her Chanel bag before panning to the rest of the room and the TV.

"#Besmart pay attention and work hard to buy @chanelofficial #remain. Where's Sunderland? Does Sarah Palin live there? Lol," she captioned it.

Following on from the video, Lindsay then took to Twitter.

"#REMAIN Sorry, but #KETTERING where are you & why is this woman @BBCNews speaking on people rather than TELLING us what happens if UK LEAVES?

"I love the #shetlands @BBCNews thank goodness we have pure hearted people our side #besmart #ShetlandsVSSunderland #BringItOn."

SNP politician Stewart McDonald then replied to her bizarre tweetes with this Mean Girls reference: "You can't sit with us."

Meanwhile, as the Sunderland vote was revealed the pound took a sharp dip against the dollar.

Reuters reports that Sterling fell as low as $1.4351 against the dollar, more than wiping out all its gains that had lifted it above $1.50 for the first time this year on the back of an earlier YouGov opinion poll.
