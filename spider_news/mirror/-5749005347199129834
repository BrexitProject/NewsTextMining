Financial giant Morgan Stanley deny plans to move 2,000 jobs from London to Germany' after Brexit

2016-06-24

Financial giant Morgan Stanley has denied they will move around 2,000 British jobs to Europe in the wake of Britain's decision to leave the EU.

Sources within Morgan Stanley reportedly said it has already begun the process of moving about 2,000 of its London-based investment banking staff to Dublin or Frankfurt - and a taskforce is in place to oversee the transition.

Many of those will be high earners and the loss of their tax is likely to be significant.

The BBC has reported the jobs are in Euro clearing but also other investment banking roles, as well as senior management.

But the financial giant denied these claims when speaking to the Mirror.

A spokesperson said: "The BBC story is completely false."
