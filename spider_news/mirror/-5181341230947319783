Brexit: New migrant crisis could hit UK after French politicians call for Calais border to be scrapped

2016-06-24

The Mayor of Calais will demand the deal that allows Britain to control the Calais border to be renegotiated following the Brexit result.

After the Leave campaign won the referendum, right-wing Natacha Bouchart called for France to look again at the Treaty of Le Touquet.

The 2003 bilateral treaty allows British border officers to carry out passport checks in Calais.

It effectively places part of Britain’s border with France in the French port.

And it allows migrants and refugees seeking to reach Britain to be held back at Calais.

She wants the border taken back to the UK, which would have the effect of moving the migrants to Kent Yesterday (Friday) she said: “For several years we have been asking for a renegotiation (of the Touquet agreement).

“There has to be room for many things to be put on the table, to know under what conditions the British will open a centre to welcome a percentage of the migrants from Calais.

“If they don't accept them, it is for them to take on the consequences of them being sent back.”

The Le Touquet Treaty is not linked to our EU membership and the French have been able to back out of the agreement at any time, providing they give two years’ notice.

But Xavier Bertrand, the centre-right president of the Hauts de France region, tweeted today: “The English wanted to take back their freedom, they will have to take back their border.”

Mr Bertrand said France should use Brexit to renegotiate a bilateral deal.

He told BFM TV: "It's up to the French government to seize this new situation and to renegotiate the 2003 Le Touquet treaty.

"(The migrants) don't want to stay in France, so it's up to the English to redefine new welcome conditions. We can no longer bear this burden in their name."
