2016-06-24

Britain has voted to leave the European Union - but was your area a Brexit or Remain stronghold?

At around 4.45pm, ITV, the BBC and Sky declared that Leave was almost certainly on course for victory.

Then at around 6am, the Brexit win was made official as it moved into an unassailable lead.

But the Kingdom is no longer United after London, Scotland and Northern Ireland all backed Remain.

With 382 results out of 382 in the EU referendum now declared, the turnout was 33,551,983 (72.16%)

The vote sparked meltdown on the financial markets and the pound fell to its lowest level in 30 years.

Then at 8.23am, David Cameron announced he'd be stepping down as Prime Minister after losing the Brexit vote.

The final YouGov poll before the referendum showed 72% of 18 to 24-year-olds backed a Remain vote - with just 19% backing Brexit.
