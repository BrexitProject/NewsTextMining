'If you are angry and heart-broken over Brexit then join the Lib Dems'

2016-06-24

As I write this I am devastated and I am angry. We look out to a country deeply divided by a fractious campaign. Even though the result was close, there is no doubt that the majority of British people want us to leave.

 The Brexit vision for Britain has won this vote, but it is not a vision I and thousands of Mirror readers share. Mirror readers are worried about their job, their mortgage and their family. All Farage cares about is being a tin pot Braveheart and wrapping himself in the flag. 

In many ways this referendum has shown how our politics is broken. We must not allow this unity to fade away.

When other parties are divided and wounded, I will reach out.

My vision for Britain is open hearted, liberal, tolerant and progressive.

Over recent weeks I have been proud to campaign with people like Chuka Umunna, Yvette Cooper and Caroline Lucas. Their progressive voices made the case, like me, for Remain. While the Eton spat took the limelight, we all did the hard graft â€“ standing up for our shared values.

Those progressive people are typified by the young, those people voted to remain by a considerable margin, but were out voted. They were voting for their future, yet it has been taken from them.

My party is proud and pro-European. So today I am urging people to join us, flock to our flag and come to us to make the case. Together, we will make our voices heard.

The Liberal Democrats will continue to stand and fight for a better kind of Britain than the one painted by the leave campaign - tolerant, openhearted, optimistic and outward looking. If you are as angry and heartbroken as I am, you need to join us today.
