Google searches for 'What is the EU?' and 'How to emigrate' spike after devastating Brexit vote

2016-06-24

Search data released by Google following the UK's shock decision to leave the EU reveals an astonishing lack of political awareness among the British population.

According to Google, the second most popular EU-related question in the UK since the referendum result was announced in the early hours of this morning is "What is the EU?"

Other popular search terms include "What does it mean to leave the EU?", "Which countries are in the EU"?, "What will happen now we've left the EU?" and "How many countries are in the EU?".

The data paints a grim picture of an uninformed public that seems to have no idea what it just voted for.

Meanwhile, disappointed Bremainers are already considering leaving the UK all together. Google searches in the UK for "How to emigrate" have skyrocketed since the Brexit vote was announced.

Twitter user John Brennan was first to notice the trend, pointing out that there had been "quite a spike" in searches from the UK.

Those worried about their future in the UK after Brexit also seem to be seeking ways to remain EU citizens.

Google Trends published data showing a 100% spike in people using the search term "getting an Irish passport".

Google also saw spikes in searches for "Move to Ireland" and "How to move to France" and "How to leave UK".
