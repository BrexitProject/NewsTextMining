2016-06-24

 Nigel Farage has claimed he has won Brexit “without a single bullet being fired”. 

 The Ukip leader’s highly inflammatory comments at a Leave.EU victory party in London come just a week after Remain-backing Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead . 

He told supporters: “The dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom!”

The millionaire former banker was met with roars of approval as he told backers: “We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks we fought against big politics, we fought against lies, corruption and deceit.

“And today honesty, decency and belief in nation I think now is going to win.

“And we will have done it without having to fight, without a single bullet being fired.

 “We will have done it by damn hard work on the ground, by people like my friend Mr [Leave.EU bankroller Arron] Banks here. And by people in the Labour party and the Conservative Party and of Ukip and no party. 

“I hope this victory brings down this failed project and leads us to a Europe of sovereign states.”

 Social media users were quick to condemn the UKIP leader, with SNP MSP Mark McDonald tweeting: "Farage is a despicable man. Utterly despicable. 'Without a bullet being fired'?!?! 

What a disgusting thing to say given recent events."

 Journalist Michael Wilkinson tweeted: "Nigel Farage claims #Brexit victory 'without a single bullet being fired'. Unbelievably insensitive and crass after #JoCox killing." 

India Knight quoted the UKIP leader, saying: "We have become disgusting."
