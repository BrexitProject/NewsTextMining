David Cameron 'set to STAY as Prime Minister' despite Brexit humiliation and growing calls to quit

2016-06-24

David Cameron is set to stay on as Prime Minister despite being humiliated by Brexit, the Foreign Secretary has claimed.

Philip Hammond said Mr Cameron has made it clear he "remains the Prime Minister and will carry out the instructions of the British people."

Mr Hammond has said that voters have "spoken clearly" and the Government's job is to "get on with that decision, protecting the economy and doing all we can to get the best outcome for Britain".

Calls for Mr Cameron to resign as Prime Minister have been growing this morning, after he failed to secure a Remain vote in the EU referendum .

Labour sources say the Prime Minister "should consider his position" in the aftermath of the shock poll.

The pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985 last night, as broadcasters called the vote for Leave.

Nigel Farage , who bragged that Brexit had been achieved "without a single shot being fired" in the moments after the result became clear, said Mr Cameron should step down "immediately".

Labour MP John Mann said: "Today is about Cameron resigning. Cameron has got to go today. He has no credibility left whatsoever. He is the most unpopular person out there.

"It's incredible how unpopular he is. He needs to carry the can - he called this referendum, he's lost this referendum."

Mr Mann - one of just 10 of Labour's MPs to campaign openly for Leave - said the outcome had "overwhelmingly" been decided by the party's voters.

And Shadow Foreign Secretary Hilary Benn joined calls for the Prime Minister to quit.

Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron had run a campaign of "bullying and intimidation", and had to go.
