David Cameron should quit today after EU Referendum result, say a string of senior political figures

2016-06-24

Calls for David Cameron to resign as Prime Minister are growing this morning, after he failed to secure a Remain vote in the EU referendum .

Labour sources say the Prime Minister "should consider his position" in the aftermath of the shock poll.

The pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985 last night, as broadcasters called the vote for Leave.

Nigel Farage , who bragged that Brexit had been achieved "without a single shot being fired" in the moments after the result became clear, said Mr Cameron should step down "immediately".

Labour MP John Mann said: "Today is about Cameron resigning. Cameron has got to go today. He has no credibility left whatsoever. He is the most unpopular person out there.

"It's incredible how unpopular he is. He needs to carry the can - he called this referendum, he's lost this referendum."

Mr Mann - one of just 10 of Labour's MPs to campaign openly for Leave - said the outcome had "overwhelmingly" been decided by the party's voters.

And Shadow Foreign Secretary Hilary Benn joined calls for the Prime Minister to quit.

Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron had run a campaign of "bullying and intimidation", and had to go.
