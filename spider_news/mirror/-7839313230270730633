Brexit could be a boost for British players but we don't want to lose Europe's best, says FA chairman Greg Dyke

2016-06-24

 Football Association chairman Greg Dyke hopes the surprise vote in favour of Great Britain leaving the European Union could work in the favour of homegrown talent. 

 The Brexit vote beat remain 51.9 to 48.1 per cent on Friday morning and left the nation pondering how the change will impact all parts of our lives. 

Football is no different with speculation now about how the exit will affect the way clubs recruit players from within the EU on top of the agenda.

Dyke said: "My position personally has always been that the decline in the number of English players getting through the system and into first teams in the Premier League is a shame and we're down to about 30 per cent.

"If it stops that (decline) that is to be welcomed. If it increases the number of English players it's to be welcomed but you don't want to lose the best of the European players wanting to come here."

 A BBC report found that without the soon-to-be renegotiated laws that allow free movement within the EU, 108 Premier League players would not have been allowed to sign for their clubs. 

Working visas are issued only to players who have featured prominently for their international teams, but EU players can come to England without any hassle.

 All eyes will now be on negotiations between the post- Brexit British government and the 27 nations that remain in the EU.
