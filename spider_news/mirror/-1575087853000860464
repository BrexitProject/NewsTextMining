Nando's responds to concerns Brexit will force closure of all UK restaurants

2016-06-24

The impact the UK's decision to leave the European Union will have on our country remains to be seen.

How will the pound fare against the Euro? Will our jobs market suffer? Will we need new passports ?

These are the important questions. But some people are rather more concerned by their bellies.

Not only are they panicking that we might not be able to eat Magic Stars anymore - more on that here - peckish Brits are also concerned that Nando's will disappear from the high street.

It all seemed to originate from a blog post that claimed all branches would be closing.

But after that racked up over 100 retweets, fear started to spread like wildfire.

But Nando's quickly rubbished the rumours and reassured everyone

The irony is, Nando's isn't even Portuguese, like everybody thinks, so it's not a European restaurant anyway.

So everyone just needs to calm down and eat their chicken, Nando's is very much here to stay.

A Nando's spokesperson told Mirror Online: “No need to worry, Nando’s is here to stay. There is no truth in any rumours suggesting otherwise.”
