Jeremy Corbyn's brother wants Brexit and is a guest at a Leave EU party

2016-06-24

 Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's brother is celebrating at a Leave EU party as he reveals he voted for Brexit . 

Piers Corbyn spoke out as he was at a Leave Party in London.

 Jeremy 's older brother said: "I hope and believe Brexit will win and that will be best for the country. 

 "In terms of the effect on politicians, it's going to be an earthquake whatever happens and my brother is, I think, the most trusted one to lead intelligent negotiations to resolve differences with the European Union if the European Union is prepared to have them resolved.” 

His opinions are in direct contrast to brother Jeremy, who has been a leading figure in the Remain campaign.

 As he cast his vote in the EU Referendum , the Labour leader appeared confident of victory. 

Leave has taken an early lead with less than 20 areas so far declared.

 Sunderland became the first region to vote for Brexit , but that has been followed by South Tyneside, Kettering and Broxbourne. 

The pound, initially bolstered by a potential Remain victory, was strong, but has since slumped following the Leave vote.

Piers Corbyn is known as a controversial weather forecaster who also denies climate change.

 As the owner of WeatherAction, Piers Corbyn claims to make accurate weather forecasts for up to a year in advance. 

The 68-year-old maverick is a fierce critic of other forecasters who back the theory of man-made global warming.

He bases his weather predictions on the sun’s activity and claims earthquakes can be triggered by the sun’s actions. He says that gives him some success in predicting quakes.
