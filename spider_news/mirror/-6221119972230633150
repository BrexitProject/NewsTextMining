On June 23 I was days from buying my first home. It’s a tiny flat but I was excited – it was going to be mine and I wouldn’t be lining the pockets of some property tycoon any more.

I’ve saved since I was 18, worked hard, and at 30 had finally built up the savings – and the courage – to take the leap into property ownership.

I’m from Derbyshire and it was bad enough knowing I could buy a three-bedroom house back home for the price of my flat in the capital. Now it seems even more of a gamble.

Among people I know, hardly anyone my age voted Leave.

Now we have no Prime Minister, don’t know where we stand with the rest of the world and don’t know what will happen.

Young people didn’t choose this but we will live with the results for the rest of our lives.
