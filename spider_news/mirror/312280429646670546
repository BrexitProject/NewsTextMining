Brexit the horse ran in a packed field at Newbury on EU Referendum day - but where did it finish?

2016-06-23

It's been a bad day for Brexit - after a horse named in support of Britain leaving the EU finished sixth at the Newbury races.

As millions went to the polls to vote on whether Britain stays a part of the EU, a two-year-old filly gave worried Leavers a possible sign of things to come.

Trained by Pat Phelan and owned by Tony Smith and The Undecided partnership, it finished sixth in a race it was third favourite to win.

Speaking before the race, Phelan said: "The boss (owner) is politically aware and had this name picked out from a long way off.

 "When the whole Brexit thing came out he thought it would be a great name for a racehorse.

"I am not so sure it reflects a political persuasion - it is more about having a name that would be topical at a particular time.

 " Brexit has come out of Windsor well. She ran very well and an auction novice is about her standard. 

"I had instructions to have her ready for Thursday and hopefully I have got that much right.

"I would be hopeful of a good run, but the ground is a bit of an unknown."

Funky Footsteps, which was a long 25/1 shot, won the 6:10 race on Thursday.
