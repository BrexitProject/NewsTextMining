Can Brits still buy EuroMillions tickets after leaving the EU? Brexit vote sparks concern

2016-06-24

 The UK has been met with uncertainty today as we face the consequences of a vote to leave the European Union . 

What that means for our country, nobody can say for sure.

 Brits are taking to social media to voice their concerns - ranging from having to buy new passports to losing Magic Stars and Nando's restaurants closing . 

One of the prevailing worries that's circulating on Twitter is that Brits won't be able to buy Euromillions tickets anymore.

But fear not.

EuroMillions operator Camelot has revealed that British punters will STILL be able to buy tickets for the lottery draw regardless of the UK's decision on the referendum.

A spokesperson for Camelot told themirror.co.uk: "EuroMillions currently operates across nine European countries and EU membership is not a requirement – for example, EuroMillions operates in Switzerland, a non-EU country.

"The EuroMillions agreement is between the lottery operators in the nine countries – not the governments.

 "Camelot is one of the founding members of EuroMillions, along with the French and Spanish lottery operators.   

"In addition, EuroMillions currently operates successfully across three different currencies – Euros, Swiss Francs and pounds here in the UK – with prizes in each country calculated using up-to-date exchange rates set on the night of that draw, once the results have been verified."
