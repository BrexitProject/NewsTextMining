Nigel Farage's EU referendum night wavering caps a bad campaign - and he must forget the sour grapes

2016-06-23

 Nigel Farage displays the confused air of a chap who feels he's beaten but is now trying to hide his defeat . 

Conceding then two hours later un-conceding the referendum caps a bad campaign for the Ukip leader.

And, should Leave lose as the polls suggest, he sounds a sore loser.

My advice is pour yourself another glass of Merlot, Nigel, because Brits hate sour grapes.

So much for Farage's commitment to democracy when he's whining the registration of 2m extra voters might win the day for Remain.

Or shouting he's "winning the war' against Europe and threatening to carry on fighting before the final result is in.

 Farage told the Mirror during the campaign he'd view a 52-48 Remain triumph as neverendum "unfinished business" and push for a second poll. 

His self-anointed role of plucky outsider confronting an establishment is a fiction when Farage is a privately educated City trade expenses junky professional politician.

But what hurts most may be the realisation he damaged the cause he gets out of bed for.

Ukip's racist "Breaking Point" refugee poster appealed to Ukip's angry core but alienated many voters the Leave lot needed to attract.

The referendum would never have happened without Farage but the most divisive figure in British politics may also have beaten himself and his cause.
