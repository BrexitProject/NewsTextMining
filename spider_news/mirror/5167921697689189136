Is it time to invest in Bitcoin? Price of virtual currency ROCKETS amid Brexit turmoil

2016-06-24

The price of Bitcoin has rocketed following Britain's decision to leave the EU.

The currency is up 7% and, at the time of writing, one Bitcoin is worth 477 GBP.

The expected remain result yesterday caused the value of the pound to temporarily bounce back. But this morning's shock result has seen it fall to its lowest value since 1985.

The pound is down 6.44% against the euro and 10% against the dollar.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin fans were excited to see the digital currency gain 20% in the last 24 hours. 

The currency has bounced back after a slump that followed good performances in May.

Bitcoin evangelists are now hailing Bitcoin as a new "safe haven investment".

Whether the "cryptocurrency" will hold its high value amid today's tumult is yet to be seen.
