Tim Farron raps John Barnes' famous World Cup song to honour his backing for Remain

2016-06-22

 The leader of an actual, real life political party has rapped to a 26-year-old New Order song on a bus in aid of the EU referendum . 

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron incited a global cringe when he trotted out his fabulous rendition of World In Motion hours before Britain goes to the polls.

One high-up Lib Dem party source joked ruefully: “I wasn’t there to overrule it”.

He was singing the part of ex-England footballer John Barnes in the 1990 official World Cup song in honour of Barnsey's backing for Remain.

 Yesterday Barnes rang up the news to tell the world he doesn’t back Brexit after Michael Gove quoted an interview he gave a month ago which said leaving the EU might be better for English footballers.

The ex-Liverpool FC legend said he was stunned to see the Justice Secretary’s bold statement in a text from his son - and promptly contacted news channels to arrange an interview.

Speaking from Johannesburg, where he was working during Euro 2016, he told Sky News: “I wanted to be left out of it, unfortunately I’ve been brought back in.”

He said he has a different view to most people on immigration - that the west helped to create the current immigration crisis, and cannot wash its hands of the responsibility.

“If everyone decided to go their own way, where would we all be?" he said.

“If we are the first to jump ship because the going gets a bit tough...that’s not what we’ve been told being British is about, it’s a very selfish view.”

He added: “I’d be surprised, I’d be flabbergasted if Britain was the first to jump ship.”
