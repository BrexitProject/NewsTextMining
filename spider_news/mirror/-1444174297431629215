Here's the John Oliver segment you can't watch on Sky TV until AFTER the referendum

2016-06-21

Comedian John Oliver's hit US show Last Week Tonight has been pulled from schedules until after the referendum, because it could breach broadcasting guidelines.

The British funnyman's HBO show, usually broadcast on Sky Atlantic on Monday nights after it premieres in the US on Sunday.

 But this week's episode contains a lengthy segment on the EU Referendum - coming down heavily on the remain side. 

The show has been postponed until 11.45pm, after the polls close on Thursday night.

In a statement, Sky said: “Sky have complied with the Ofcom broadcasting restrictions at times of elections and referendums that prohibit us showing this section of the programme at this moment in time.

"We will be able to show it once the polls have closed on Thursday.”

In Sunday night's show, John Oliver perfectly summed up how many people feel about the EU, in a sweary song declaring "f**k the European Union - but we'd be bats**t crazy to leave."

Set to the tune of Beethoven's Ode To Joy, Oliver suggested it as a late entry in the contest for a new European anthem.

 It came at the end of a lengthy and hilarious section of his US TV show Last Week Tonight, during which he mercilessly lampooned Nigel Farage , describing his 'Breaking Point' as "toxic." 

 And the British comedian, who rose to fame as a correspondent on The Daily Show, described Boris Johnson as "a man with both the look and the economic insight of Bam Bam from the Flintstones." 

 He tore strips off Vote Leave's battle bus, which bears the dodgy '£350m a week' figure. 

Oliver suggested it should read: "We actually send the EU £190 million a week, which as a proportion of our GDP makes sound fiscal sense. In fact, considering the benefits we reap in return... oh s**t, we're running out of bus! Okay, bye-bye!"

 And he skewered Michael Gove's claim that the British people were "fed up of experts". 

He joked: "Yes. F**k these eggheads with their studies and degrees, I get my economic forecasts from Clever Otis, the GDP predicting horse."

 The host, known for his visceral dissections of political spin and propaganda, closely examined claims made by Brexit :The Movie - a feature length anti-EU polemic by director Martin Durkin. 

The film claims pillows are subject to 109 separate EU regulations.

On closer inspection, the regulations they list on screen, include several which have nothing to do with pillows.

They included:

 He played the Mirror's exclusive video of Ukip parliamentary candidate Robert Blay, who said a rival was "not British enough" to be an MP , because his family had only been in Britain since the 1970s. 

Oliver retorted: "Must he be a monacled badger named Reginald who lives in a shepherd's pie? Is that the bar of entry to him?

 He even took aim at the term Brexit , saying it sounds like a "s**t granola bar you buy at an airport." 

  

 F**k you, European Union! 

 Tally-ho, you f**king pr***s! 

 We are the United Kingdom! 

 You can eat our spotted dicks! 

  

 That being said, 

 We're not going to leave you, 

 Turns out we need you! 

 Nonetheless, 

  

 F**k you, European Union! 

 It feels good to tell you this! 

  

 Poland is depressing, 

 And there's vampires in Romania. 

 Spain is far too hot 

 And where the f**k is Lithuania? 

  

 To be fair, Slovenia's lovely, 

 (We're only kidding, it sucks too!) 

 But we must admit, 

 Without these countries 

 We'd be really screwed! 

  

 F**k the European Union, 

 Even though we must admit, 

 We would all be bats**t crazy, 

 If we vote for leaving it!
