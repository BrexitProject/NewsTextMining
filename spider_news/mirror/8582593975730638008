Niall Horan slams EU referendum results and calls Nigel Farage a 'terrible man'

2016-06-24

 Niall Horan has joined many disgruntled Brits voicing their concerns over the results of the EU referendum . 

 The Irish singer has been left disappointed after the nation voted in favour of leaving the European Union, and hit out at Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage for his comments following the news. 

 Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Ukip leader admitted the call to divert an extra £350 million a week to the NHS was a big mistake - and the One Direction star has called him out for it. 

In a series of tweets, Niall wrote: "It's a sad day . The economic impact that this is going to have is definitely going to make those voters regret their decision.

"And I see farage is talking c**p and telling lies as per usual on telly . Let's see what he does now . He really is a terrible man

"How can you sway that many people into thinking their health service is going to be funded and when the vote goes your way... tell them we shouldn't hae said that and it was a mistake. Bulls*** (sic)"

The official Leave campaign's suggestion money saved from contributions to the European Union could be spent on the health service instead featured on buses, posters and was a key plank of their campaigning.

But the Ukip leader, who was not part of the Vote Leave campaign, would not guarantee the NHS would get the extra funds.

Asked on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he told Susanna Reid: "No, I can't and I would never have made that claim - it was one of the mistakes that the Leave campaign made."

Mr Farage went on: "It wasn't one of my adverts. I think they made a mistake. They made a mistake in doing that.

"We have a £10 billion a year, £34 million a day featherbed - that is going to be free money that we can spend on the NHS, on schools, or whatever it is."
