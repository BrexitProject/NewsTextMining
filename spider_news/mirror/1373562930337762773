How will my MP vote in the EU referendum? Search our full list by name or constituency

2016-06-21

The EU referendum is nearly here - and although they get no more say than the rest of us, we all want to know what our MPs think.

It's good news for David Cameron , who now has a clear majority of Tories in Parliament backing his pro-Brussels fight.

But more than 130 Tories still want Out including 17 ministers - and they're joined by at least 10 members for Labour.

So what's your MP's view? Which Labour MPs back Brexit ? How are the Tories split - and who's keeping mum?

We compiled a painstaking search tool from letters, statements, tweets, local press, campaigns, debates and where that fails, calling the MPs themselves.

More than 200 Labour MPs joined the party's In For Britain group way back in November, but at least 10 are planning to vote Out.

They include maverick Beast of Bolsover Dennis Skinner, Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field and Parliamentary Labour Party chairman John Cryer.

Some Tories are only planning to reveal their views after they hold public debates.

Others, like Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, may keep tight-lipped for the rest of the campaign.
