Do not cry for David Cameron as he skulks away - just fear who comes next

2016-06-24

Shed no tears for David Cameron - but shudder at who might come next.

An arrogant Prime Minister skulks humiliated out of Downing Street after a tactical referendum backfired disastrously for the Buller Boy and Britain.

He's out of No 10 and the country will be out of the European Union.

It was never intended to end this way when he agreed a vote to head off Ukip and Tory head bangers.

But it has and Cameron goes down in history as a failure who gambled and lost badly.

Remember Tory austerity and NHS privatisation, the bedroom tax and bombing Libya, rather than feeling sorry for him.

I thought Cameron would quit today but it's remarkable how Brexit Tories don't want to own the economic and political mess they triggered.

They wanted Cameron to stay and resist moves to start pulling out Britain as they fret the opening of Pandora's Box may destroy them too.

Cameron going may open the door for Boris Johnson or Theresa May.

The same old Tory politics with a new face, perhaps, but the fear is both would veer to the Right to satisfy the Conservative red meat Goers.

People may soon feel buyer's remorse, wondering if they were conned into backing Brexit when all that extra cash for the NHS doesn't materialise .

But Cameron exits with his tail between his legs, possibly taking George Osborne at the Treasury with him.

And we are lumbered with Camaggedon. Thanks Dave - for absolutely nothing.
