How to get an Irish passport after the Brexit vote and remain a European Union citizen

2016-06-24

Now the UK has voted Brexit, some frustrated Remainers are hoping Ireland will provide them with an EU passport.

Eagle-eyed holidaymakers will have noticed British passports say 'European Union' across the top of them.

There is uncertainty at what the Leave vote means for Brits with the Passport Office declining to comment when contacted by the Mirror.

Being an EU citizen carries with it certain benefits and there are fears we may lose them.

People with an EU passport are allowed to move freely and reside anywhere in the union.

They are entitled to work in any of the member states without needing a work permit.

And they get an EHIC card when they travel to Europe which can be used to access free healthcare. 

It is unclear whether any or all of these rights will be extended to British citizens post-Brexit.

You could be eligible for an Irish passport if you have an Irish parent or grandparent.

The Citizens Information Board in Ireland says if either of your parents was an Irish citizen who was born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen, irrespective of where you were born.
