86 Tory Brexit MPs sign letter saying David Cameron should remain Prime Minister - whatever EU Referendum result

2016-06-23

Nearly two thirds of Brexit-backing Tory MPs have sent a letter directly to David Cameron saying he should remain in office.

The letter was signed by 84 out of the 135 Tory MPs who supported a Brexit vote and was posted on Twitter by MP Robert Syms - with Stephen Metcalfe and Justin Tomlinson added after the letter's release.

Prominent Vote Leave campaigners Michael Gove and Boris Johnson are among the MPs who have signed the letter - despite Mr Gove and Mr Johnson undermining the PM by setting out an alternate plan for the country.

They write: “We thank you for giving the British people a choice on their destiny on 23 June 2016.

“We believe whatever the British people decide, you have both a mandate and a duty to continue leading the nation implementing our 2015 manifesto.”

But other prominent Tories including Iain Duncan Smith and die hard Brexiters including John Redwood were not on the list.

The letter was revealed minutes after the polls closed at 10pm in the EU referendum , just as an on-the-day poll from YouGov showed Remain had a 4-point lead over their rivals.

The Tory party was split almost 50/50 on whether the UK should remain part of the UK, but late declarations brought remain ahead, with 186 for remain 135 for leave.



The 86 MPs listed on the letter are:
