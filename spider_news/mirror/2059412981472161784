Nigel Farage MUST apologise and scrap his disgusting "Breaking Point" refugee posters

2016-06-19

Venom-filled, rabble-rousing, trouble-stirring Nigel Farage playing the victim is deluded self-pity from a political leader either ignorant or in denial about the dangerous results of his spiteful bile.

The Tory/UKIP-dominated Leave plot to drag Britain out of Europe is in turmoil, with senior figures blaming each other for shameful, anti-migrant­ propaganda­ which critics say echoes 1930s Nazi demonisation of minorities.

Instead of whining and complaining he’s been picked on, Farage should apologise and scrap his disgusting “Breaking Point” refugee posters – especially when the unfortunates pictured were neither in nor heading for Britain and never could, so long as we stay in the European Union .

Tory Leaver Michael Gove is swimming in the same moral cesspit as floundering Farage after the UKIP leader peddled his scare stories about Turks coming to Britain. They are two peas in the same festering pod.

The Leavers must clean up their campaign before Thursday’s seismic, irreversible decision.
