EU Referendum: Opinion polls released on eve of vote suggest result remains on knife edge

2016-06-22

Opinion polls released on the eve of the EU referendum suggested that the result remains on a knife edge.

One survey put Leave ahead on 45%, with Remain on 44% and 9% still undecided while a separate poll found 51.4% want to stay in the European Union , against 48.6% who want to withdraw.

The second survey, conducted by FTI Consulting , suggested that, even after weeks of campaigning, there is still plenty to play for, with 28% of voters claiming that they could still change their minds.

Adam Drummond, whose company Opinium Research carried out the first poll on 3,000 voters, said: "This really is 'too close to call' territory, with undecided voters holding the balance of the vote in their hands.

"Although referendum campaigns normally see a move back to the status quo as we get closer to polling day, this hasn't yet shown up in our polls and the Remain camp will have to hope that it happens in the polling booth itself if Britain is to stay in the European Union."

Despite repeated warnings from economists and Remain campaigners that Brexit would inflict serious damage on Britain's economy, around one-third (34%) of those questioned told Opinium that they expected the economy to remain "about the same" if the UK left the EU and 55% said the same about their personal finances.
