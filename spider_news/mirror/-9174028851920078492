Harry Kane reveals England team discussions over EU referendum at Euro 2016

2016-06-24

 Harry Kane, the England and Tottenham striker, gave his views on the shock result of the EU referendum during a press conference on Friday. 

Over 30 million people turned out to vote on whether the UK should remain a part of the European Union on Thursday, with the overnight count revealing 52% of voters were in favour of exiting.

Kane was asked for his opinion on how the result would affect foreign imports coming to the Premier League and whether homegrown players will now have a better chance of playing regular top flight football.

"Of course it's hard not to know it's gone on, but it's not really something that I've thought too much about yet," Kane said.

"Obviously I'm focusing on the Euros and what's ahead. I guess we'll just have to wait and see."

He added: "We woke up today and saw the news and a few of the lads were talking about it.

"But I don't think the lads are too focused on it to be honest. The Euros is the main thing, trying to progress and do well in that. I don't think any of us know too much about it to comment on it. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.

"I don't know enough about it to be concerned about it and I don't think the other players do as well."

Meanwhile, FA chairman Greg Dyke said the result could be good news for grassroots football - despite himself being firmly in the Remain camp.

 He told Sky Sports: "One of my concerns in my period as chairman has been the decline in the opportunities for kids at the bigger clubs to get through and into the first team - very few make it. 

"If anything happens that gives them better chances, then I welcome it."
