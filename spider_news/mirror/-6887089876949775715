Church pastor claims GOD supports Brexit during his Sunday sermon

2016-06-20

A church leader claimed it is "God's view" that Britain should leave the UK during his Sunday sermon.

Paul Hedger delivered the sermon last Sunday where he told his congregation he would be voting to leave the EU on June 23.

One man walked out during the sermon at Isleham High Street Church in Isleham, Cambridgeshire.

Other angry parishioners claim he was pushing his own political views but he defended his speech saying he had a responsibility to inform them of God's views.

 One churchgoer who did not want to be named, said: "The congregation was shocked to hear the lead pastor openly campaign for the Brexit camp. 

"We go to church to pray and serve God and not be told how to vote in matters that have nothing to do with God.

"God's house is not for campaigning. The decisions we make about political issues must be kept away from the church.

"A person's vote must be their sole decision without any influence from the man of the cloth."

In the sermon, Mr Hedger said he wanted to take a "risky approach" of sharing where he stood.

He said: "All of us would want God's perspective and as followers, once you have God's perspective we have a responsibility as Christians to see it through God's eyes.

"We have to ask ourselves, how would God see it?"

He said while God liked nations, he "takes a different view of empires", which he said the European Union was moving towards.

Mr Hedger defended his position and said: "I see it as the church's responsibility on issues that affect our lives to inform people.

"My aim with what I said was to help them see there may be a higher agenda above what politicians say.

"I think as Christians and as a Christian leader, my responsibility is to help people see things the way God does.

"I would stand by everything I said and a lot of people from our church have been very supportive."
