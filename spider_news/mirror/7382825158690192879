City traders 'braced for mayhem' if Brits vote for Brexit in EU referendum

2016-06-23

Market traders are braced for 'mayhem' and could see an emergency trading session if Britain votes to leave the European Union.

 City experts believe traders may be forced to stay chained to their desks over the weekend as the market enters volatility not seen since the collapse of the Swiss Franc in the event of a Brexit vote. 

 Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said Brexit could lead to massive changes in the value of sterling and an emergency meeting of the Bank of England. 

 He said: "If there is a Brexit there could be mayhem in the markets and traders could well have to cancel their plans and work right through the weekend. 

"We could easily see an emergency trading session on Sunday like in 2008 and/or a temporary halt to trading on Friday.

"We've heard lots of mutterings about an emergency bank holiday and special meeting of the Bank of England.

 "No-one really knows what might happen as there has not been anything like this to base scenarios on. There is no playbook for a Brexit ." 

He added that he was readying himself in the event of "wild gyrations" in the value of sterling and the possibility that some banks may fail to execute orders on their electronic trading platforms.

 Britain's biggest banks are drafting in staff to work through the night on Thursday into Friday as they gear up for the EU referendum result. 

Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and US giants such as JP Morgan Chase and Citi are among those calling in senior traders and workers for what is set to be a turbulent 24 hours after voting closes at 10pm.

 Market analyst Tony Cross, of Trustnet Direct, said currency and market traders were getting set for "the biggest night of their careers", adding that if Britain does vote for Brexit then they could be camped at their desks for days.
