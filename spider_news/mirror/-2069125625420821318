David Cameron is toast - he cannot go on after Brexit vote

2016-06-24

David Cameron is toast - he will not last long now.

The Prime Minister has been absolutely humiliated .

Calling the referendum was a tactical move by him, that's proved to be a catastrophic strategic error.

The party, the members and the voters have gone in another direction.

He will go down in history as the Prime Minister who inadvertently took Britain out of the European Union.

He said it would be a recession, it would wipe out far more than we put in and Britain would suffer.

There is no going back from here - he will be out of Downing Street very quickly.
