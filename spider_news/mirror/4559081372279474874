James Corden supports 'vote Remain' as he gives a passionate speech on the Late Late Show

2016-06-23

James Corden has urged people to vote Remain.

The Late Late Show host took a moment out of his show yesterday evening to weigh in on the referendum in a last ditch attempt to sway voters.

As he told the audience he doesn't normally get political, James explained that he felt too strongly about the vote to remain silent.

"I'm not one to usually get very political," he told the audience.

"But I really hope we all vote to remain in the EU. It will be better for our economy, better for our industry, and better for our international relations.

He insisted: "But mostly because it represents so much more than that."

He went on: "In today's world, barriers should be going down, not going up. Our show plays in 135 countries, I don't even think I can name 135 countries."

"Wherever someone was born, we can share the same jokes and stories and interests. Ultimately, we are all in this together. I hope the people of Britain go out and vote remain," added James.

James isn't the only celebrity to publicly declare their support for remaining in the EU over the past few days.
