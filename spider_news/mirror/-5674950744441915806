ITV cancel This Morning and Loose Women for rolling Brexit coverage and viewers aren't happy

2016-06-24

 ITV's decision to cancel This Morning and Loose Women on Friday morning has been met with outrage from viewers. 

 The broadcaster has opted to replace its regular daytime programming in favour of rolling coverage of the UK voting to leave the European Union and David Cameron 's subsequent resignation as Prime Minister. 

 A statement on Loose Women's official Twitter account read: "Due to the # Brexit vote, @ITV will be airing rolling news coverage this morning and there will be no live Loose Women today." 

It follows a similar comment from the This Morning team, who revealed there will be "continuous coverage of the historic vote".

Viewers have reacted, with responses ranging from angry to tongue-in-cheek outrage.

One said: "@itvthismorning no break from the misery of this awful news then?"

One concerned user quipped: "And they told us nothing will change its already happening @itvthismorning not on today I can't cope with change #arrghh (sic)"

Another wrote: "Hitting home how big this day is...ITV have cancelled This Morning and Loose Women....jesus, what have we done (sic)"

One viewer even teased that it was the sign of an impending Armageddon.

They added: "No way!! What's the country coming to! Taking @itvthismorning off air - it's startedâ€¦ #Armageddon"
