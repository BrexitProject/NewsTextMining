Boris Johnson's own dad, brother and sister all against him on Brexit

2016-06-21

 Boris Johnson casts his vote on Thursday with his immediate family all snubbing his Brexit pleas. 

The Tory MP has failed to convince either father Stanley, sister Rachel or brother Jo to quit the EU - with all piling into the Remain camp.

Most of the former London mayor’s much-travelled blond clan, who are all high-profile in politics or journalism, are backing In.

Sunday newspaper columnist Rachel wrote in February: “I’m on Team Boris – I always will be, blood is thicker than water – but in June, I’ll vote with Dave.”

Stanley, a former MEP, said in April: “I respect those who, like my eldest son, Boris, have a different perspective ... But unlike Brexiteers, I believe it is best to fight from within. That’s why I will vote Remain.”

 And Science Minister Jo warned two months ago that Brexit would threaten the UK’s position as a “global innovation hub”.
