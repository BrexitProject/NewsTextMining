Jermaine Pennant's question about Brexit is the best thing about the EU referendum

2016-06-24

Today is a very serious day.

 The people of Britain have voted to leave the European Union. Whether you voted to Leave or wanted to Remain, the current mood across the nation is one of real concern and heavy, deep thinking. 

So thank the heavens we can rely on certain former Premier League footballers to lighten the mood.

 Because frankly, even if you are distraught at the outcome of the EU referendum, one tweet from Jermaine Pennant should bring a smile to your face. 

Check out this beauty of a question from the former Arsenal and Liverpool winger:

A few points to make:

The next Euros are in 2020, not 2018.

 Brexit means we're leaving the EU, not Europe. 

And finally, even if we WERE to be booted out of the next European Championships, we're pretty sure Jermaine wouldn't have to alter his summer plans.

His chances of an England call-up may now have passedâ€¦
