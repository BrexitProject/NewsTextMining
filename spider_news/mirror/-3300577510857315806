First Brexit, now a Tory leadership race - next stop a general election

2016-06-24

Harold Wilson once said a week is a long time in politics. Nowadays 10 minutes is an eternity.

Even in the seconds before David Cameron appeared on the steps of Downing Street Tory bigwigs were saying he should stay .

Business minister Anna Soubry said he needn't go only a few minutes before he did. And when he had she said she wasn't surprised.

If politicians were as good at foresight as they are at hindsight Britain might be a better place.

Boris Johnson will certainly throw his hat into the ring now. Justice Secretary Michael Gove might, too.

Home Secretary Theresa May kept largely out of the fray during the referendum campaign , and may enter it now.

But while outwardly confident in public she is painfully shy in private, and may recognise she's not suited to the top job.

Anyway a committed Brexiteer is more likely to get it. So keep an eye on Energy minister Andrea Leadsom .

She's shone during the campaign ever since blazing into the spotlight for the Mirror Live EU debate last month.

She's got the steeliness of Margaret Thatcher, but without the hostile handbag.

David Cameron wants an orderly handover so we do not have to begin Brexit negotiations with the EU until October. Handovers rarely go as planned.

But in this case the Tory Party conference is a good time to anoint the new leader. So Cameron's timetable may yet hold.

And what will the new leader want? A General Election, that's what. To establish a personal mandate. That could happen in October, too.

The British people have just demonstrated a ferocious appetite for democracy with seven out of ten of them turning out to vote in the referendum.

That's good. Because there's a lot more of it on the menu.
