Boris Johnson spent the last day before the EU referendum kissing a fish and flying by private jet

2016-06-22

Boris Johnson has spent the eve of the referendum kissing fish, pulling pints and kicking back on a private jet.

 The bumbling blonde Brexit backer can barely have managed a few hours of shut-eye since last night's debate. 

 He got a bit of a battering from Tory colleague Ruth Davidson , and his London Mayoral successor Sadiq Khan . 

But the polls are still neck-and-neck - and Boris needed to get himself out there and fight for every vote.

So the self-styled antidote to the country's 'out of touch elites' pulled himself out of bed, shrugged off his bruises, and hopped aboard a series of luxury vehicles of aircraft for one more lap of the country.

Here's how it happened

He flew from Southend to the East Midlands to continue his campaign.

There was barely enough leg room to cross his legs as he read the business section and munched on an in-flight biscuit. It was ghastly.

Billingsgate market is great. Look how happy it made Boris to be there.

Kissed it right on the mouth.

He's more of a cappuccino man.

And a sit down on a bench

The man of the people. The antidote to the out of touch elites who want to keep us tied to the EU. Looking down on his people from a private helicopter.
