Brexit could lead to gold rush after UK votes to leave the European Union and pound plummets

2016-06-24

 Bullion dealers are forecasting a gold rush after the UK voted to leave the European Union. 

Britain's biggest online dealer, BullionByPost, was expecting its biggest ever trading day after the pound plummeted to its lowest since 1985 and the price of the precious metal soared.

 As the polls closed on Thursday night gold was trading at $1,256.50 an ounce, reports the Birmingham Post. 

 But it started to accelerate swiftly as early results from the referendum began to feed through. 

By this lunchtime it was trading at $1,336. 66, a jump of 6.3% in dollar terms, but much more in sterling terms once the fall in the pound is taken into account.

Rob Halliday-Stein founded the Birmingham-based BullionByPost in 2008.

 He had previously predicted a Brexit would prompt a gold rush which could generate his firm sales of up to Â£10 million in a single day, as investors seek to protect their wealth. 

 Mr Halliday-Stein said: "Gold rises on volatility and we've never had a day as volatile as a Brexit day in the gold price market." 

This morning the company said it was "incredibly busy with customers."

 The online firm had already seen a marked rise in people selling off their gold before the Brexit vote, with the first two weeks of June seeing trade up 54 per cent on the same period last month.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for The Birmingham Gold Company, based at the Jewellery Quarter, also said business was booming this morning - but said the gold rush might not last long.

 "A drop in the pound always sees the price of gold rise, but I think it is just a flash in the pan while the markets react to Brexit ," he said 

"But we are expecting to be busy today."
