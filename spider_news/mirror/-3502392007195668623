Brexit campaign rocked as ANOTHER senior figure leaves over 'hate and xenophobia'

2016-06-20

Another senior figure ditched the floundering ‘Leave’ campaign last night over the ‘hate and xenophobia’ spread by its shameless leaders.

Former Tory Cabinet Minister Baroness Warsi said she will vote Remain on Thursday after hearing Vote Leave chief Michael Gove “peddling lies”.

Lady Warsi, who was Communities Minister from 2010-2012 and then Minister of State in the Foreign Office from 2012-2014, said the final straw had been UKIP chief Nigel Farage’s infamous ‘Breaking Point’ poster showing a line of worried refugees.

She told the Times: “That poster was for me the ‘breaking point’ - to say, ‘I can’t go on like this’.

“Are we prepared to tell lies, to spread hate and xenophobia just to win a campaign?

“For me that’s a step too far.”

It marks another big blow to the 'Leave' campaign after a similar defection last week.

The respected chair of the Commons health committee, Dr Sarah Wollaston MP, abandoned Vote Leave over its repeated lie that EU membership Britain £350million a week.

The Cornish GP said the best way to help the NHS is to vote Remain.

She immediately faced a torrent of abuse from Leave campaigners, and Lady Warsi faced similar treatment last night.

Tory MP Nadie Dorries even claimed Lady Warsi was not part of their campaign in the first place.

“Sayeeda Warsi has never been #VoteLeave. It's just a trick in the remain grid. Another will come along tomorrow,” she wrote on Twitter.
