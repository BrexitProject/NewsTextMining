'Democracy failed us': Damon Albarn addresses Brexit at Glastonbury as festival-goers brave the mud

2016-06-24

 Damon Albarn declared "democracy has failed us" as he took to the stage at Glastonbury. 

The Blur frontman addressed crowds at the Pyramid stage this morning after the UK voted to leave the European Union.

"I have a very heavy heart today," he told the audience as he prepared to play with The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians.

"Because to my mind, democracy has failed us. Democracy has failed us because it was ill-informed."

As the crowd cheered and clapped he continued: "And I just want all you to know that when you leave here we can change that decision. It is possible."

 Posters have also been popping up across the site with a poem about the EU Referendum decision. 

"It's a day none of us have felt less British," one poster reads. "As those around us crack open breakfast wine and shout for revolt, I think we're pretty safe in the knowledge that it's nobody's here fault.

"So let's trudge on through the mud, and sing out loud our protest songs. As the country is divided, in this field we belong."

Meanwhile, festival-goers have been wading through thick pools of mud as the three-day music event kicks off in traditional style.

The mud has caused delays to the Other Stage, with the Glastonbury Twitter account posting a message to say: "The Other Stage is opening now. Apologies for the delay as we repaired damage to the field."

Headliners this year include Adele, Muse and Coldplay, with other artists including Ellie Goulding, Jess Glynne, Foals, ZZ Top and New Order.
