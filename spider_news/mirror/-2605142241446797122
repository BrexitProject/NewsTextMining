The eyes of the world were on Gibraltar's returning officer but he had his big moment stolen

2016-06-23

Everyone has their 15 minutes of fame.

If you are the Returning Officer for Gibraltar you could be forgiven for thinking that day may never come.

 But tonight Paul Martinez was handed a worldwide platform when the British territory counted up its 20,145 votes in the EU Referendum quicker than perennial first-past-the-posters Sunderland. 

The whole of Britain, Europe and perhaps even the world were hanging on Martinez' words.

 He geared up to deliver the first result of the ' Brexit ' referendum, opened his mouth and... a phone rings in the audience. 

You can tell from his face that Martinez is less than impressed.

A few seconds after the rogue ringer was silenced he delivered his people's verdict and luckily they spoke louder than the annoying ringtone.

In an absolute landslide for Remain, there were 19,322 (95.91%) ticks in the box for 'In' and just 823 (4.09%) for 'Out'.

Remain's majority was 18,499 (91.83%) and that put turnout at an impressive 83.53%.

After rallying the gang so brilliantly to vote and count, it's just a shame that there's always one who won't switch off their phone.
