Brexit bad luck hits retailers - ASOS site crash and Dorothy Perkins hashtag fail

2016-06-24

 On the day that half the nation mourns the impending exit of the UK out of the EU, two major retailers are left reeling from their own dose of Brexit bad luck. 

 Online fashion giant ASOS ' site has crashed and people are losing it as a consequence. 

It's been well over 12 hours since the website and app first encountered problems, and disgruntled shoppers have taken to Twitter (as you do) to vent their discontent.

The retailer's customer service Twitter account ASOS Here to Help sent this message to their followers over six hours ago:

 At the time of publishing this article the site remains down... Could this be Brexit bad luck striking again? 

 Elsewhere in the social stratosphere high street fashion store Dorothy Perkins came a cropper when someone on their social team seemed to forget that the EU referendum results were being released on the day they sent out this positively perky post: 

"Woo! Who has that #FridayFeeling?"

To which Twitter responded in suitable fashion:

Suddenly that Friday feeling isn't so good...
