Will Brexit make driving more expensive?

2016-06-24

Big issues like immigration, the economy and your rights at work are grabbing the headlines, but will there be a direct impact on your day-to-day life too if Britain votes to leave the EU?

Here Lucy Thomas, deputy director of BSE, and Matthew Elliot, chief executive of Vote Leave, look at what could happen to the cost of driving after Britain votes to quit the EU.

Those who want Britain to leave Europe do not have an answer to the everyday issues that matter most to British families - like the cost of filling up the car.

The petrol we use is made mostly from oil imported from other countries. When the value of the pound is strong on the international markets the cost of imports falls. When the pound falls import costs rise. Economic experts believe leaving Europe would cause the pound to plummet, making imported oil pricier.

If this happens, the AA estimates the cost of a litre of fuel could rocket by 20%, to more than 120p.

Campaigners to leave have admitted that a Brexit would be "an economic shock". A higher cost of petrol would be just one of the painful effects of this.

The head of the BSE campaign rather let the cat out of the bag when he admitted that after we Vote Leave nothing will change in the short term.

Of course we'd start the process that would mean no longer paying Â£350million a week to the EU and end the supremacy of EU law, but when it comes to jobs, exchange rates and the economy things would go on as they are.

This is why petrol prices would remain unaffected. Goldman Sachs, the In campaign's bankrollers, have tried to suggest otherwise, but they lost all credibility when they said we should join the euro or three million jobs would be lost.

Car insurance, though, would go down in price. A recent EU court judgement put it up. Just another example of how Brussels makes life more expensive.
