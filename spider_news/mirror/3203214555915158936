We need to work together to fight crime and terrorism and that's why we must Remain

2016-06-21

 The claims made by the Brexit campaign that being in Europe somehow makes Britain less safe are at best misleading, and at worst, irresponsible. 

 Leave campaigners forget that the UK isn’t part of Schengen and no-one can come here from Europe without being checked. 

 The reality is that Britain drives EU crime policy because it is critical to our effort to fight terrorism and serious crime. 

In the wake of recent terrorist atrocities, our priority should be to strengthen EU-wide information and security systems, not cut ourselves off.

The notion that we can stand alone in this highly connected world and be as effective is simply nonsense.

 We need to work together to fight crime and terror with our EU partners using tried and tested systems that work. 

If you are not in the club you don’t get the benefits.

The arrest warrant will go, joint investigation teams will go, access as of right to intelligence will go.

 EU Referendum countdown 

We will be on the outside looking in, not at the centre influencing and driving change.

Those who wish to leave have completely failed to explain how they will fix any of these issues.

Playing Russian roulette with citizens’ safety is inexcusable and disgraceful. Britain is safer in Europe.
