2016-06-24

 Roy Hodgson said on Friday he had “no reaction” to Britain’s monumental decision to leave the EU. 

 The England boss, who has previously worked in Sweden, Switzerland, Italy and Denmark, woke up to the news at the team’s Euro 2016 hotel in Chantilly. 

 Hodgson, 68, watched David Cameron’s resignation speech before leaving for training. 

 But asked by the Mirror for his views on the Brexit , he simply replied: “I’ve no reaction at all.” 

The England camp have constantly refused to comment on the EU debate while in France.

When asked on Thursday if he had voted, Wayne Rooney said it was a “private matter”.

FA bosses gave Hodgson and his team advice on how to vote while away for the tournament.

They told the players how to apply for postal voting before they left for Chantilly.

 The Brexit result could have an affect on the number of foreigners playing in the Premier League. 

Other sports stars have been more vocal in their views on the referendum.
