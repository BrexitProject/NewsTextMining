Euromillions draw: Does Brexit mean a British winner can't claim tonight's £31 million jackpot?

2016-06-24

 Tonight's Euromillions prize draw takes place this evening with the jackpot estimated to be a whopping £31million. 

 But people are worried that if a Brit was to scoop the massive prize yesterday's historic Brexit vote would mean they wouldn't be able to claim it. 

 Many took Twitter to ask one of the many question raised by the EU referendum result. 

Claire McLeish wrote: "Reports that if a UK ticket wins Euromillions they wont be able to claim it."

Jonnie asked: "If my numbers come up on the Euromillions lottery tonight, are we still eligible to keep the winnings?"

Meanwhile Sue Lee joked: "If my Euromillions ticket is a winner tonight and I can't claim my winnings, I will kill Boris Johnson with my bare hands. Twice."

But the Mirror Online can reveal that if a British winner has the winning numbers tonight, they WILL be able to claim their prize.

 A statement from Camelot said: "EuroMillions currently operates across nine European countries and EU membership is not a requirement – for example, EuroMillions operates in Switzerland, a non-EU country). 

"The EuroMillions agreement is between the lottery operators in the nine countries – not the governments.

"Camelot is one of the founding members of EuroMillions, along with the French and Spanish lottery operators.

"In addition, EuroMillions currently operates successfully across three different currencies – Euros, Swiss Francs and pounds here in the UK – with prizes in each country calculated using up-to-date exchange rates set on the night of that draw, once the results have been verified."

As well as tonight's enormous cash prize, a holiday to New Zealand is up for grabs.
