Boost to the pound as markets predict EU Referendum Remain victory

2016-06-23

 Early indications that ' Remain ' have won the ' Brexit ' referendum are set to boost the pound. 

 On the back of Nigel Farage ’s apparent concession, and the latest poll which hands ‘In’ a 4-point lead, the City has rallied. 

Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts a slim winning margin of 2% could be enough to send sterling above $1.50.

“The pound has had a cautious reaction to news that the Remain camp might have pipped the Leave camp to the post, according to an unofficial exit poll” she said.

“Traders appear to be sitting on the sidelines though, as we wait for the first set of results due in approximately two hours.

“We mentioned earlier today that the margin of victory could also determine how much the pound would rally on the back of a win for the remain camp.”

Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading firm IG, said: "Financial markets seem to have reached a conclusion, with the pound still broadly higher in overnight markets and FTSE futures pointing towards yet more gains.

"While the race has appeared neck and neck, financial markets have consistently expected the Remain campaign, the status quo option, to emerge victorious.

"With the pound still gaining ground against the euro and having seen a fresh highs against the US dollar for the year, and with the FTSE 100 having bounced impressively in the past few weeks, we would be in for a remarkable night, and an even more remarkable few weeks ahead, should the Leave campaign win through in the end."
