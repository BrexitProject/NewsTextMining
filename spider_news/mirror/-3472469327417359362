'I found my 10-year-old crying in bed': Heartbreaking real-life consequences of Brexit already being felt

2016-06-24

It's been a matter of hours since it was announced that the UK has voted to leave the European Union in an historic referendum.

It's thrown up a lot of questions about British people's futures - whether that's related to currency, travel or jobs.

But most poignant are the heartbreaking stories of people in tears because they don't feel welcome.

These are people who have lived in this country for years - who have married in this country, had children in this country and built their lives here.

They now face an uncertain future as the repercussions of the Brexit vote sink in across the UK. Below are just 11 stories. 

When it comes to foreign EU nationals already living and working in the UK, they will not be deported from the country.

EU nationals who came to this country legally, under rules that existed when they arrived will not be made to leave, as reported by the Birmingham Mail .

Earlier today, in a speech in which he resigned, Prime Minister David Cameron said: "I would reassure Britons living in European countries and European citizens living here there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances."
