On EU Referendum day vote to free Britain from the shackles of Europe and stand on its own two feet

2016-06-18

Four days to go. Four days till Britain decides its destiny .

All of you reading this know where I stand.

I want Out of the EU , mainly because I want Britain freed from the shackles of the unelected, unaccountable, economically busted flush that is the EU, and standing on its own two feet.

When we joined the EEC back in 1973 it comprised of just nine countries which accounted for 36 per cent of the world’s economy.

Today, with 28 countries, it accounts for just 17 per cent – and that’s plummeting as we speak.

I want to leave for all the reasons I’ve told you about – to take back control, to make our own laws, to be able to decide who comes here and in what numbers, to free small businesses from the crippling burden of EU bureaucracy.

To help farmers by ditching the Common Agricultural Policy which raises prices in shops by £400 per household per year.

To let British fishermen take as much fish as they want out of our waters.

EU Referendum countdown

I’ve never for one second believed Britain can’t stand on its own. Nor am I naive enough to think it’s going to be easy.

But I do believe that whatever (temporary) pain there might be initially, the end result – an independent, financially robust Britain that’s 100 per cent responsible for its people, its economy, its laws and its policies – will be worth it.
