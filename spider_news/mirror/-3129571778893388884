Brexit: Cheeky voter draws PENIS on ballot paper - but it's still counted 'because it is erect'

2016-06-24

A cheeky voter decided to vote by drawing a cartoon penis on a ballot paper.

And according to a TV newsman, Remain still counted it as a vote 'because it was erect'.

 The bizarre vote caused a minor argument among campaigns in West Dunbartonshire who could not decide whether the ballot was deliberately spoiled or a vote for Remain.

The penis had reportedly been drawn in the Remain box.

But according to Holyrood Editor for STV, Colin Mackay, officials counted the vote because it appeared to be a 'positive endorsement'.

 And cheeky Mr Mackay even tweeted a tongue in cheek joke to followers about the 'vote'. 

He wrote on Twitter: "Remain say they are cock a hoop with the penis vote."

The Electoral Commission guidelines state a vote can be counted if ‘the intention of the voter clearly appears on the ballot paper’.

West Dunbartonshire saw more than 71,000 people vote.

It voted to Remain with 53.96% backing staying part of the EU and 46.06% voting to leave.

There were 36 rejected ballots.
