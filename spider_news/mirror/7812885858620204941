EU Referendum: The view of foreign correspondents across Europe

 Pablo Guimon, UK correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Pais 

"Around 200,000 Spaniards live in the UK and 310,000 British citizens live in Spain.

"The UK is Europe’s first destination for Spanish migrants, and Spain is the first destination for British migrants. So – surprise! – we want you to stay. Following your debate has been one of the most amazing experiences in my career.

"I have admired the maturity of your democracy. I became angry when the debate seemed to be monopolised by a xenophobic fear of migration, unfairly blamed for all the things that don’t work.

"Like most Spaniards, I hope you decide to stay in. And let me have, like so many British friends, my own well-deserved holiday in the sun."

 Catharine Jentile de Canecaude, London bureau chief for French TV station TF1 

  

  

"The majority of French people want the UK to stay, for political, professional and sentimental reasons.

"We often have the impression there is rivalry between the UK and Europe, but when we get to the really important matters, the French will always come to the aid of the British. But if the UK leaves Europe relations between our two countries cannot be the same, that is for sure.

"I have found the debate interesting. I have noticed the usual British composure has disappeared and become brutal in arguments on immigration and the economy."

 Thomas Kielinger, London correspondent for German newspaper Die Welt 

  

  

"Germans are keeping their fingers crossed that it will be a Remain result.

"If Britain left, Germans would not just be disappointed, but shocked. There is no template to evaluate what that decision would mean. Nobody has ever left the EU.

 "This story was slow to develop, but in the last few days it has been absolutely hysterical. My hunch is that fear of what happens after Brexit will produce a Remain result."
