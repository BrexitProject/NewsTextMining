2016-06-24

 Outspoken columnist Katie Hopkins has infuriated residents of Liverpool after branding the city “benefits central” in a controversial Twitter commentary on the UK’s Brexit vote. 

 As results came in through the night, the notorious TV personality – who was backing the leave campaign – began to give her verdict on the areas declaring. 

 She shared a tweet giving Liverpool’s verdict on the referendum, before adding in a second post: “Liverpool. I wish you only malice”, adding “benefits central”. 

 The Daily Mail and former Sun columnist – who once said “I don’t really like fat people” – went on to offer Gloucester and Maidstone her virginity. 

 She then described West Devon as “the truth and the light”, reports the Liverpool Echo.

Scousers quickly hit back, with Mike Withey saying: “I’m certain that Liverpool wishes you Enlightenment, Empathy, a Brain and a Heart.

"Apart from that please stop stealing Oxygen.”

Rob Skelton wrote: “Insult a city because they have a different opinion to you? Seems like a sensible, adult debate.”

Kieran Carr told her: “Very sad comment about Liverpool. It’s called democracy.”

Meanwhile Mikey Riley said: “I wish we could vote you out... Oh wait no where else will have you?”

 Last year the former Apprentice contestant faced condemnation over insensitive tweets made following the murder of Merseyside PC Dave Phillips. 

She compared the emotional press conference held by the officer’s grieving family to a “X Factor VT [videotape]”.

The 41-year-old has been branded a “professional troll” and last year was questioned by police over allegations of inciting racial hatred over a dehumanising comment piece that compared migrants to cockroaches.
