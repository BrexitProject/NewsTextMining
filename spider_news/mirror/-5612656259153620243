Remain referendum campaigners strip virtually naked to 'expose the effects' of UK leaving European Union

2016-06-19

A pair of confident 'Remain' campaigners have strolled around a busy city centre this afternoon virtually naked in a bid to "strip down the argument for Brexit".

Claire Green and Sibi Moore staged the protest to "expose the effects" leaving the EU would have on future generations in the United Kingdom.

They set off from Stokes Croft, Bristol, at around 2.30pm and walked to the bustling Harbourside.

Sibi was painted as a Union Jack and Claire decorated herself as an EU flag.

The pair handed out leaflets as they made their way through the city with nothing but lashings of blue body paint and skimpy shorts and knickers to protect their dignity.

Sibi, 20, said: "One of the reasons we wanted to do this is because there has been a lot of focus on the various political parties and what they are saying.

"And the fact that David Cameron has come out in support of staying in might put off some people.

"But this is not about political parties and their ideals - this is about the people's vote.

"We wanted it to be slightly playful and get people's attention and we thought this would be a good idea."

"We are trying to make a statement," she added.

Sibi and Claire began their protest in front of a mural of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump kissing.

It comes just four days before British voters take to the polling booths to decide whether the UK will stay or leave the EU on Thursday.

Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, it is not an offence to be naked in public in England unless it is done with the intention of causing "distress, alarm or outrage".
