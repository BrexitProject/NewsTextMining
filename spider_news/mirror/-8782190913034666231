Nigel Farage voted for Brexit in PEN amid claims EU referendum votes in pencil would be 'rubbed out'

2016-06-24

Nigel Farage has confirmed to the Mirror that he voted in the EU referendum in pen.

He seemed rather taken aback to be asked the question, but confirmed he had marked his cross in ink - not pencil - this morning.

All day conspiracy theorists have been making wild claims about a shadowy government plot to steal the referendum from Leave by erasing ballots filled in with a pencil .

A rumour started on social media gained momentum throughout the day, causing voters concern that their votes will be 'rubbed out' if they vote in pencil so the referendum can be rigged.

The simple fact is that the UK always votes with pencils in elections - but you are allowed to use a pen if you wish.

The Electoral Commission even tweeted to address the concerns and confirm that nobody has to use them.

And the conspiracy was kicked up a notch when East Northamptonshire Council urged voters NOT to use pens when they cross their EU referendum ballot papers - as it could cause them to "smudge" and therefore not count.

This afternoon East Northamptonshire Council tweeted a plea to anyone heading to the polls, urging them to use pencils as "ink can smudge when its folded... & it may not be counted." (sic)
