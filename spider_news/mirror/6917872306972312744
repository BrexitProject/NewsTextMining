EU referendum odds - should you bet for Remain or Brexit?

2016-06-23

The choice faced by British voters in the EU referendum today is in some ways as simple as a coin toss: In or Out?

Of course it is far more complicated than that, with the UK's economic and political future at stake.

But when the arguments for and against Brexit so often seem to be based on interpretation rather than facts, it can be very difficult to get a clear idea of which side is winning.

The confused picture emerging from the EU referendum poll results lends little clarity to the situation.

So what do the bookies make of the likely EU referendum result? Currently a vote to Remain is odds on - but then this is only a two horse race...

A vote to stay in Europe remains odds on with the bookies. After drifting last week in the wake of three polls showing a lead for Leave in one day of poll results, the odds have hardened again.

Ladbrokes, 21 June

Ladbrokes' head of political betting Matthew Shaddick said: “This is the biggest non-sporting event the bookmaking industry has ever seen with £100 million expected to be wagered by the time the polling booths close on Thursday night. The EU referendum has overtaken last year's General Election and the Scottish independence referendum as the largest political betting event of all-time.

“On the eve of the vote we see a very similar scenario to last year’s General Election, with polling showing a dead heat but the betting demonstrating a significant tilt towards one outcome: a vote to Remain in the EU. Three quarters of all stakes at Ladbrokes yesterday were for that outcome and we see a 76% chance of that result materialising.”
