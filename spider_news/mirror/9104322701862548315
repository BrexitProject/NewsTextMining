Rail passengers left stranded and unable to vote in EU Referendum after lightning strike

2016-06-23

 Hundreds of rail passengers have been left stranded after major services were cancelled leaving some to claim they were left unable to vote. 

Thameslink services from London to Brighton was axed after a complete loss of signalling after a landslide and power cut thought to be caused lightning striking overhead power cables.

The operator warned users of the disruption in a series of tweets saying they would send staff to trains and arrange bus replacement services.

 But angry passengers said they were left unable to get home to cast their ballot before polls closed at 10pm. 

One angry passenger wrote: "So what I want to know @TLRailUK is how many of your passengers lost their vote today because you couldn’t get them home?”

Another said: “@TLRailUK 3 hrs to get home...triple the normal time and I’ve missed my chance to vote in the biggest day in British history in my lifetime.”

 Tim tweeted the rail operator saying: “@TLRailUK were there people stuck on trains unable to get to Polling Stations to vote?” 

One joked: “@TLRailUK if only we could vote you out! (Topical eh?). Nah, in all seriousness your company is absolutely useless.”

The Environment Agency warned continued heavy rain could lead to further flooding across England and the South East, affecting homes and businesses and causing delays and cancellations on rail, roads and the Tube.

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operating companies and Network Rail, advised passengers travelling through affected areas that "services will be severely disrupted".

He went on: "Passengers should check before they travel and consider travelling earlier if they can in order to get home."

Thameslink did not answer to a request for comment.
