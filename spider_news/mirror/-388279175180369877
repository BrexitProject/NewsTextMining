Premier League reacts to Brexit as it prepares for effects of leaving the EU

2016-06-24

 The Premier League have given a statement on the outcome of the EU referendum , stating 'there is little point second guessing the implications until there is greater clarity'. 

As with most walks of life, football will be affected in numerous ways by the historic political vote which has seen Britain vote out of the European Union.

Clubs will now not be able to sign young players from within the EU until they are aged 18 or over, perhaps putting them at a disadvantage against some of the continent's other sides.

 With suggestions this could aid the long-term future of Britain's national teams, however, the Premier League have released a cautious statement about the overall impact of the vote. 

A spokesman said: â€œThe Premier League is a hugely successful sporting competition that has strong domestic and global appeal. This will continue to be the case regardless of the referendum result.

"Given the uncertain nature of what the political and regulatory landscape might be following the 'Leave' vote, there is little point second guessing the implications until there is greater clarity.

"Clearly, we will continue to work with Government and other bodies whatever the outcome of any process."
