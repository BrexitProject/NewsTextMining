Brexit petition calling for a SECOND vote on EU referendum is so popular it crashed the website

2016-06-24

A petition calling for a second EU referendum is proving so popular that the website has crashed.

The page reads: "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule that if the Remain or Leave vote is less than 60% based on a turnout less than 75%, there should be another referendum."

It has received more than 130,000 signatures already at the time of publishing - sailing past the 100,000 needed for a debate in Parliament.

Several users took to Twitter to complain that they were having trouble accessing the site.

A House of Commons spokeswoman said: "UK Parliament and the Government Digital Service are aware of the issue and are working on this to ensure the site is working well.

"The site was temporarily down for some users due to high volumes of users."

If a petition gets more than 10,000 signatures, the Government will respond. At 100,000 signatures, this petition will be considered for debate in Parliament.

It comes amid revelations that younger voters will be the losers from today's historic vote to leave the EU after polls repeatedly showed they back Remain.

Brexiters were led to victory in the referendum overnight by triumphing in Tory shires and Old Labour heartlands in Wales and the north of England.

But the Kingdom is no longer United after London, Scotland and Northern Ireland all backed Remain.

The more damaging legacy, however, could be the staggering difference in how people of different ages planned to vote.

The final YouGov poll before the referendum showed 72% of 18 to 24-year-olds backed a Remain vote - with just 19% backing Brexit .

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: "Young people voted to remain by a considerable margin, but were outvoted. They were voting for their future, yet it has been taken from them."
