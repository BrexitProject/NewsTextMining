The City claws back finances after Brexit as share hunters go bargain hunting

2016-06-24

Money markets went into meltdown today - but it could have been worse.

The pound had tumbled more than 7% against the dollar by mid-afternoon.

 However, the fall wasn’t as severe as the slump billionaire investor George Soros predicted when he warned Britain could endure a Black Friday if it voted to Leave . 

That was based on the pound dropping more than 15% against the dollar.

Share prices went into freefall within minutes of the markets opening in London.

The FTSE 100 initially crashed more than 500 points which, if it had stayed that way, would have been the biggest one day drop in its history.

However, it clawed back a large chunk of those losses, with investors - many of whom will have made a packet from the volatility - reassured by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s comments that it stood ready to prevent another financial crisis.

And other investors saw the stock market fall as a buying opportunity.

Around 80% of the trades placed through stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown’s share dealing service were purchases. This compares to around 60% on an average day.

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown:, said:

“Private investors are clearly seeing today’s market fall as a buying opportunity, and are out in force bargain-hunting. “The most popular stocks are also those which have seen their prices hit hardest this morning, namely the banks and house builders.

“We know that private investors have been sitting on the sidelines until after the referendum, and early indications are there may be some buying activity now the market has dropped.”
