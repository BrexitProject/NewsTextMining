Gary Lineker says what we've all been thinking about Nigel Farage

2016-06-23

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker didn't hold back when it came to his opinion on Leave campaigner Nigel Farage.

The England legend branded the UKIP leader a d*** - a VERY thinly veiled insult.

Lineker took to Twitter to tell his almost five million followers EXACTLY what he thought about the politician.

It comes as Mr Farage first appeared to concede defeat to the Remain campaign - but then changed his mind just two hours later.

Clearly unimpressed with Mr Farage's inability to stick to any of his announcements (remember when he quit after last year's election), Lineker just couldn't hold back.

And it isn't the first time the football hero has made his feelings about Mr Farage very clear.

Back in April he called the politician a d*** for the first time - well, publicly anyway - following televised debates.

Who know what he'll come out with if the nation votes for Brexit and Farage gloats.
