Vladimir Putin slams David Cameron's claim Russia influenced Brexit vote in EU Referendum

2016-06-24

 Russian premier Vladimir Putin has slammed David Cameron over Brexit in this extraordinary video. 

He hit back at the outgoing prime minster's claim the Kremlin influenced yesterday's historic vote to leave the European Union.

Speaking in Uzbekistan, the Russian president said: "This is the choice of the people of Great Britain.

"We in no way interfered in this, are interfering or planning to interfere."

 Brexit will have both positive and negative consequences for Russia and the world but the situation will correct itself in the near future, Putin said. 

He added that Russia would adjust its economic policy if necessary.

President Putin said: "We will closely follow this and analyse it.

"We will be trying to minimise some negative impact on our economy from this decision, because we see if it hit the markets now, currencies, then of course it will reflect on market indexes and prices for our traditional goods. But I am confident it will be corrected soon."

Putin also said the outcome of the referendum reflected Britain's unhappiness with migration and security worries as well as dissatisfaction with EU bureaucracy.

He accused Cameron of attempting to use Russia to influence public opinion.
