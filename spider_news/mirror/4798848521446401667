2016-06-24

Bookmakers now appear to be shifting towards Brexit .

Leave has now overtaken Remain as favourite on Betfair for the first time.

Just a few hours ago Alex Donohue of bookies Ladbrokes said: "The chance of a remain outcome is back up to a record high as polling booths shut.

"We're not calling it just yet, but it would seem like leave require a pretty big upset to pull this off."

Nigel Farage had initially appeared to concede defeat to the Remain campaign but then changed his mind and said "anything could happen"

Since then Leave has secured some huge victories with Sunderland the first to declare for Brexit .

Bury, Redcar and Cleveland, Hartlepool, Blaenau Gwent and Middlebrough have all voted for Leave.

The pound has also slumped following the surge in support for Leave.

There has also been a massive spike in Google searches for 'what happens if we leave the EU'.
