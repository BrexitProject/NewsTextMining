Leave won the EU referendum because the country voted with its heart rather than its head

2016-06-24

 Leave won because anger trumped fear. The country voted with its heart, not its head. 

Remain had based its whole campaign on the assumption that elections are won or lost on the economy. It believed that if the electorate realised their jobs, security and prosperity were on the line then they would vote overwhelmingly to stay.

But they sorely underestimated the emotional pull of sovereignty and misread completely the genuine sense of grievance in the country.

The victims of globalisation took revenge on those who have benefited from it.

More than anything the referendum exposed the deep divisions within the United Kingdom.

It pitched the old v the young, England v London and Scotland, and the prosperous middle class v the working class. It was the opportunity for people to vent their anger at rising inequality, stagnant wages, insecurity and the impact of immigration.

Leave cleverly played on these anxieties. They offered a memorable message of “take back control” that tapped into the feeling of patriotism.

 Leave’s strategy was to do anything it could to distract attention from the Remain argument that leaving the EU would be an act of economic suicide . 

They wanted the TV debates dominated by immigration and Turkish membership.

They knew that every time Remain had to expose a lie, the lie itself got a hearing.

The result exposed the limitations of David Cameron’s appeal. Labour’s role was also crucial.

With the Tory vote split, getting Labour backers out was essential. But not even the appeal of all the major trade unions nor the vast majority of Labour MPs was able to persuade enough of the party’s core base to back Remain.
