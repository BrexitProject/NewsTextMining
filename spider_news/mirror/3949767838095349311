Vladimir Putin suggests David Cameron called Brexit referendum 'to blackmail or scare Europe'

2016-06-17

 Vladimir Putin tonight waded into the Brexit debate - and suggested PM David Cameron may have called a referendum "to blackmail or scare Europe". 

British politicians have previously speculated that the Russian president would relish the UK leaving - as it would both weaken the EU and hand Russia the opportunity to reassert itself on the continent.

Asked what his views on the looming vote are in St Petersburg tonight, Putin bizarrely hinted that the PM had a secret agenda.

He claimed he could have deliberately called the referendum to "scare" Europe.

But the normally straight-talking leader refused to be drawn over which side he supported - instead claiming such questions were a trick to make Russia look a bogeyman.

Putin said: "I don't think this is very proper to engage Russia in all the problems, even if we are not involved in it, to make Russia a scarecrow.

"Civilised people do not do things this way.

 "As for the Prime Minister of the UK, there is a great problem with Brexit , why did he initiate this vote in the first place? 

"Why did he do that? So he wanted to blackmail Europe or to scare someone, what was the goal if he was against?

 The Russian president appeared well-clued up on the ongoing debates raging in Britain - and the arguments for and against Brexit . 

But he steadfastly refused to guess which way the vote will go next Thursday.

He added: "I want to say it is none of our business, it is the business of the people of the UK.

"I have my own opinion on this matter, I cannot talk about the result yet - no one knows about the result yet, I think it is 50-50 with a certain margin of error."

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has been particularly vocal in the past over Putin's agenda when it comes to him secretly wanting Britain to leave the EU.
