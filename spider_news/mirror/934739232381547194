Drivers warned petrol prices set to rise by 3p a litre after Brexit vote

2016-06-24

 Drivers are being warned of a bumpy Brexit ride with pump prices set to rise by up to 3p a litre. 

Despite the cost of oil falling by almost 5% to $48.44 as the vote was announced, millions of British motorists will not benefit as sterling took a battering against the dollar.

Within a week the cost of unleaded is likely to leap from an average 111.78p a litre to 114.78p a litre.

Diesel, currently around 111.98p, could increase to 114.98p.

Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the falling pound would have an immediate impact on the forecourt.

 The RAC’s Fuel Watch spokesman Pete Williams, expects pump prices to jump by about 2p a litre at a time when they should be falling. 

He said: “We were anticipating a drop in prices at the pump of just over one pence on unleaded and two pence on diesel as wholesale prices had dropped.

“However, while we have seen a significant drop in the price of a barrel, the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar is likely to make the wholesale cost to UK retailers higher, meaning a price rise of around 2p per litre is likely in the next week.”

And the AA said drivers can expect to pay £1.25 a tank more.

Campaign group FairFuelUK urged oil-producing nations not to use Brexit as an excuse to squeeze the UK’s 37 million drivers.

There are fears of one price for Britain and another for the EU nations following the referendum.

Howard Cox, of the FairFuelUK Campaign, called plans to penalise UK drivers with higher prices “nothing short of opportunistic, vindictive and unnecessary”.
