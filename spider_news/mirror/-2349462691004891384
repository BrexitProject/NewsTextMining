Love Island viewers panic show will be axed after Brexit result

2016-06-24

Will Brexit affect Love Island? Surely that's the big issue today and fans are taking to Twitter with a mixture of sarcasm and genuine concern.

One fan wrote: "They're probably going to have to film Love Island in Barry Island now."

Others just got confused with one saying: "Someone just asked me who I voted for and I said Olivia."

Another viewer drew a parallel, saying: "First Malin, now Britain, shocking exits all round."

One Twitter user summed up the mood of the nation, saying: "2 big votes this week, the public got 1 right. Malin leaving #loveisland was the right decision. The other....who knows?! #brexit"

Another with a curious grasp of what constitutes the United Kingdom suggested Guernsey.

A Twitter user named James Barnes said: "My main concern about # Brexit is that more people my age are bothered with what's happening with the overgrown teenagers on Love Island."

Whereas Mikey Nolo took the opposite view, saying: "If your watching anything about brexit over love island then your doing it wrong. Life's too short man enjoy it."
