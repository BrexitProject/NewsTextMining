Eurotrash host Antoine de Caunes insists BRITS are the real eccentrics after wacky show returns

2016-06-17

 Eurotrash host Antoine de Caunes displayed a collection of wacky European characters on a Brexit-themed special but says it is us Brits who are the real eccentrics. 

 Despite being a regular in the UK, the Frenchman , 62 – who co-presented the show with designer Jean Paul Gaultier – said: “You are still very different and that is what I like. 

“For me, England is like Japan, except you have a sense of humour.

“You have such a different way of looking at things, measuring, thinking. It is very linked to the fact you are an island, just like Japan.”

 The show returned to Channel 4 after a decade away for a special. And if successful, it could lead to a comeback. 

Host Antoine de Cannes told the Mirror: “We stopped the show ten years ago and since then every Brit I have met always says, ‘why don’t you bring it back? We need this kind of show.’

“We stopped it because we wanted to stop it and we thought it was time to give it a break. But when you feel that people really want it back, that is great. I would love to do a series again.”
