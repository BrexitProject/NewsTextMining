2016-06-24

The parts of Britain that voted Remain tend to be better paid by about £50 per week.

 Exclusive Mirror analysis of the EU referendum results shows that the areas that opted for Britain to leave the European Union earned £410.47 on average per week in 2015. 

Remain areas meanwhile earned £459.52 per week.

This makes a difference of almost £50 per week between Remain and Leave areas.

The top five most well-paid areas in Britain were all in west London - places such as Westminster and Richmond - and they all voted to stay in the EU.

Brentwood was the most well-paid place to vote Leave.

Workers in the Essex district earned £614.10 per week last year on average.

 On the other hand, the 11 parts of the country where workers earned the least all voted in favour of Brexit . 

These include Great Yarmouth, Blackpool, Scarborough and Thanet.

Leicester was the most poorly paid place in the country to vote Remain.

The average worker in Leicester earns just £343.80 per week, compared to £425.80 per week nationally.

In three areas - two Remain and one Leave - the Office for National Statistics couldn’t provide an accurate earnings estimate, which meant we calculated the averages with those areas at zero.

 We didn’t have access to the full data for this analysis - we had to ‘average the averages’ to get these figures.  

 Leave: £410.47  Remain: £459.52  Difference: £49.04
