Spain calls for 'Spanish flag on Gibraltar' after Britain decides to leave European Union

2016-06-24

The Spanish government has called for 'the Spanish flag on Gibraltar' after Britain decided to quit the European Union.

Despite Britain's decision to leave - Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly to Remain, with 95.9 per cent of voters backing the Remain campaign.

The British Overseas Territory at the entrance to the Mediterranean relies heavily on its open border with Spain for trade.

Acting Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said he hoped "co-sovereignty" of Gibraltar and "the Spanish flag on the Rock" were much closer to happening in the wake of the vote.

Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo, who shared a platform with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in May in support of the Remain campaign, had earlier tweeted: "We have surpassed greater challenges. It is time for unity, for calm and for rational thinking.

"Together and united we will continue to prosper."

He is due to give a speech on Friday afternoon.

 Julie Girling, the South West England and Gibraltar Conservative MEP - who also backed Remain, said; "I am deeply sorry that the people of the UK have chosen this leap in the dark. I believe future generations will question our wisdom. 

"The EU has many faults, of course, but I remain convinced that we would be safer, stronger and better off by remaining a member."
