The opinion was posted by a Financial Times (FT) reader, who describes "three tragedies" of Britain's decision, Wales Online reports .

The insight has been shared thousands of times on social media.

The result caused a social media frenzy, with Remain supporters expressing their disbelief and grief.

On Friday afternoon, one tweet had been retweeted more than 16,000 times and liked more than 12,000 times after being shared by Nicole Perlroth on Twitter. But it was being shared from several other accounts too.

She said: "The most articulate take on # Brexit is actually this FT reader comment today."
