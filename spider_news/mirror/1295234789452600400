7 reasons we're going to miss Slaven Bilic's Euro 2016 punditry as ITV confirm his departure

2016-06-24

Forget the EU referendum and the debate about Brexit. When it comes to departures from Europe, we now have a whole new nightmare to deal with.

 Slaven Bilic is leaving ITV's Euro 2016 team. 

 The West Ham manager has been not just been the tournament's best pundit; he has been one of the best things about the tournament full stop. You lot confirmed as much when you put him top of our pundit power rankings. 

Sadly, the charismatic Croatian is now returning to The Hammers to prepare for pre-season. ITV have confirmed that this was always going to be the case - that Bilic was only ever going to cover the group stages.

That hasn't softened the blow. Here are the MANY reasons we're currently distraught our new favourite pundit has been taken from us…

If there's one person who's going to miss Bilic even more than us, it's Wrighty.

 Who could forget the time Lothar Matthaus started talking about Germany's defeat to Croatia at the 1998 World Cup… and former Croatia defender Bilic held up three fingers and said, "3-0. I was there". 

BURN, LOTHAR!

Perfectly summed up here:

 When Dimitri Payet scored for France against Albania, how do you think the West Ham manager celebrated one of his West Ham players scoring on the big stage? 

By climbing onto the desk of a TV studio, of course…

They should probably just give him his own show now, to be honest.

"Sit quietly and look riveted while Lee Dixon waffles on? I DON'T THINK SO…"

Was it a dare? A bet, maybe?
