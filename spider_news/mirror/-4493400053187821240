How will my area vote in the EU referendum? Interactive map of the Remain and Leave strongholds

2016-06-23

Fenland in Cambridgeshire is the most pro-Brexit place in the UK.

National polling for today’s EU referendum currently has a Brexit hanging in the balance with just one percentage point separating leave and remain.

The final result may still hang in the balance but Open Europe, a think tank, have conducted an analysis of data from the British Election Survey to help people get a sense of which way the country may be leaning.

According to their calculations, which factored in attitudes to the EU along with demographic data and national polling results, voters in Fenland are apparently the most ardent anti-EU place in the country with the leave vote ahead by 38.5 percentage points.

This was the biggest margin for any local authority ahead of Boston in Lincolnshire and South Holland, also in Lincolnshire.

At the other end of the scale the most apparently clear cut local authorities are the City of London and Edinburgh where remain is ahead by 48.2 and 47.6 percentage points respectively.

Across the UK, Open Europe’s analysis suggests that two local authority areas - Lancaster and Eden - are split exactly down the middle on whether to leave the EU.
