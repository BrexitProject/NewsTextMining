The entrepreneurs said companies will thrive once freed from the Brussels “straitjacket”.

“These attributes will ensure that our economic performance continues to outstrip that of the rest of the EU bloc.”

The 37 signatories were led by Luke Johnson, the former Pizza Express boss now heading cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.

 Leaving would be devastating for Britain’s long-term prosperity

Richard Branson

Meanwhile Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson stepped up his calls for people to vote Remain in Thursday’s EU referendum.

He claimed leaving would be “devastating” for Britain’s long-term prosperity and he did not want to return to the pre-EU days he remembered when it was “difficult” for businesses to operate effectively.



He acknowledged that he personally lived overseas, in the British Virgin Islands, but insisted he had “never stopped caring passionately” about the UK, where Virgin Group employs some 50,000 people.

His nationwide campaign kicks off with online and social media messages today and newspaper ads tomorrow.
