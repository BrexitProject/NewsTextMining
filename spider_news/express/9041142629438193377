GETTY

The Home Office reacted with fury at the landmark ruling, which comes when a Sudanese teenager detained after being found in the back of a lorry won the right to damages yesterday.

Lawyers for the Home Secretary Theresa May branded the decision “absurd”, saying it is difficult to assess the age of an asylum seeker with no documentation.

The High Court heard the case of “AA”, a Sudanese teenager who was detained because an officer said he “reasonably believed” he was an adult.

‘AA’ claimed he was about 17 but had no documents to back this up.

High Court judge Sir Stephen Silber said: “My task is not to ascertain what would lead to the most efficient running of a fair immigration system but to apply the established principles of construction.”

Refugees are set to undergo medical testing in Sweden to verify claims from migrants about their age.

The Swedish Migration Agency claim there is reason to doubt as many as 70 per cent of asylum applicants who say they are between the ages of 15 and 17.
