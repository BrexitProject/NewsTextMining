WATCH: The historic and earth-shattering moment the referendum was called for Leave

2016-06-24

At 4:40am on June 24, both the BBC and ITV, followed closely by Sky News, announced they were projecting there was no way the Remain side could overtake Leave.

Minutes earlier Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who has dedicated his political career to fighting the EU, had declared an “independence day” for Britain.

He said: “The dawn is breaking on an independent UK. If the predictions are right this will be a victory for the real people, for the ordinary people, and for the decent people.

“We've fought against the multinationals, the merchant banks and big politics' lies corruption and deceit.

"We've done it without having to fire a single bullet but through hard work and graft.

"We've done it not just for ourselves but for the whole of Europe. I hope this victory brings down this failed project."

Turnout in the EU referendum fell narrowly short of the UK record for the total number of people voting.

The Electoral Commission said 72.2% of those registered cast eligible votes - some 33,568,184.

That is just short of the 33,614,074 who decided the 1992 general election.

The highest post-war turnout was 83.9% in the 1950 general election, but a smaller population meant that was only 28,771,124 votes.

In the 1975 referendum on British membership of the then European Economic Community, 25,903,194 people voted - 64.6% of those eligible.
