The figures revealed that more than 600 artworks have been acquired, with around 480 pieces purchased with European taxpayers’ money.

The paintings and sculptures on display in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg have been labelled “one of the most extensive modern art collections of the last 25 years”.

Research showed that in recent months £54,000 was spent on acquiring art from Hungary, from Poland (£121,000), Slovakia (£31,000), Slovenia {£15,000), Malta (£11,000), Bulgaria (£42,000) and £81,000 on art from Romania.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign group, said: “These startling figures show that EU officials are using hardworking British taxpayers’ money to fund a shrine to the European project.”

Meanwhile, EU officials who have been sanctioned for corruption, tax avoidance and sexual harassment have been allowed to keep their jobs, a new document from Brussels reveals.

Records of disciplinary action taken against EU employees showed that only one member of staff was dismissed for rule breaches last year.

The report also showed that 30 cases were not followed up and 31 were deemed as having no case to answer.

Sixteen employees were cautioned for various alleged misdemeanours.
