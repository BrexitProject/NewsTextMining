However Brussels would crumble if France and European powerhouse Germany decided to leave, Alexander Lambsdorff MEP has said.

The deputy president of the European Parliament said a British exit from the EU following the June 23 referendum was not a “horror scenario” and it would live on whatever happens. 

He said: “The EU is imaginable without the UK, but not without Germany or France. 

“The UK was not in at the beginning and they are just too peripheral for their membership to be the determining factor.

“It won’t be the end of ‘Project Europe’ as some are describing it.”

However, Mr Lambsdorff admitted encouraging a British exodus was a “mistake". 

He told a German newspaper: “Creating incentives for leaving would be a fundamental mistake.”

The German official’s intervention comes just two days before Britons head to the polls for Thursday’s momentous EU referendum. 

However Mr Lambsdorff’s approach may come as a surprise as previous interventions by German officials have made it clear they want the UK to remain. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel waded into the debate headfirst last month warning Britain it “won’t get a good deal” if it backs Brexit.

Meanwhile, a poll revealed an overwhelming 80 per cent of Germans are pleading with Britain to remain in the 28-nation bloc. 

An overwhelming four out of five people living in Germany do not want Britain to leave Brussels. 

Meanwhile, Germany appears to be trying to bribe the UK to remain by giving out sausages so UK meat-lovers will know what they would miss in the case of a Leave Vote. 

German trade organisation Jungen Unternehmer has been canvassing in London against a British exodus and are demanding the EU take action.
