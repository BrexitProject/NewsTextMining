The former London mayor launched a scathing attack on the Remain campaign and accused them of offering “no change” to Britain’s “current democratic arrangements”.

He added: “If we vote Remain, we stay locked in the back of the car, driven by someone with an imperfect command of English, and going in a direction we don’t want to go.”

 We are not more powerful, or more influential for being around the table in Brussels

Mr Johnson, 52, also took a swipe at the “orgy of backslapping” of top EU institutions.

He said: “If we vote to stay then I am afraid the whole EU caravan carries blithely on; and when I think of the champagne-guzzling orgy of backslapping in Brussels that would follow a Remain vote on Friday, I want to weep.

“We must not let it happen.”

The crusading Brexit supporter also condemned David Cameron’s “pitiful” EU negotiation earlier this year.

He added: “We are not more powerful, or more influential for being around the table in Brussels – look at the pitiful results of the so-called renegotiation earlier this year.

“We are drowned out.”



But a ICM poll conducted just a week ago put a Brexit ahead by six points.

Referendum campaigning was suspended on Thursday after the tragic shooting of MP Jo Cox, but restarted over the weekend.
