IMF managing director Christine Lagarde will meet eurozone finance minister today in Luxembourg to talk about Brexit. 

The discussions, which have staggeringly been left until just a week before the EU referendum, will focus on the economic issues from Britain's potential exit from the EU.

Last week the International Monetary Fund along with the Bank of England warned of the severe economic consequences of leaving the EU.

 The Wetherspoon beer mats questions why Greece is in such trouble after six years of IMF advice

However, the Brexit campaign has printed out Wetherspoon beer mats questioning why we should trust the IMF or Lagarde and telling punters to vote out.

The beer mats point out that the IMF chief is facing trial over £290 million payment to businessman Bernard Tapie.

The IMF warned of a cycle of lower growth, less spending and higher unemployment if Britain were to leave the EU.

Last month Ms Lagarde said the economic impact of Brexit ranged from "pretty bad" to "very, very bad". 

She said: "We are not doing it out of politics, this is not the job of the IMF. 

“We're doing it because it's a significant downside risk. And second, it's not just a domestic issue it's an international issue."

They read: "Dear Madame Lagarde,

"At Wetherspoon, we sincerely respect and admire the French people and your country, but note that you are due to stand trial in France for your part in authorising a €400m payment by the French state to Bernard Tapie - a supporter of your political party."

Ms Lagarde signed off a huge €400 million payment to Mr Tapie as France's minister of finance at the time.

She has been accused of negligence by a person in a position of public authority.
