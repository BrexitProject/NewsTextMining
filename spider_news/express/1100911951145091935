EU is not so sweet: UK sugar maker Tate and Lyle urges workers to BACK BREXIT

The sugar makers, in business since 1878, reportedly sent a letter out to their staff urging them to vote Leave. 

Issued from one of the top bosses, senior vice president, Gerald Mason, wrote to workers telling them that the business would be more viable it if was not bogged down by EU red tape. 

He claimed the company, one of Britain’s oldest, was preventing from turning a profit last year due to EU regulation. 

Mr Mason said: “Last year EU restrictions and tariffs pushed our raw material costs up by nearly 40 million euro (£31million) alone, turning what should have been a good profit that we would all share into a 25 million euro (£19m) loss.

"We pay as much as 3.5 million euro (£2.7m) of import tariffs to the European Union on some of the boats of cane sugar that unload at our refinery, only for the European Union to then send that money to subsidise our beet sugar producing competitors in Europe.”

He primarily blamed a policy in Brussels of favouring the continent’s sugar beet refiners over cane refineries, hampering his profit. 



The vice-president added: "(They said) that if we lose our jobs then that's democracy because there are more beet producers than cane refiners in Europe. That is not the sort of democracy I want to be part of.”

Operating their sugar refinery on the Thames, the company recently launched the Save Our Sugar campaign, urging the EU to adopt a fairer policy between beet and cane manufacturers.

The historic vote on whether the UK should remain or leave the European Union takes place tomorrow, June 23, with the polls opening at 7am after months of campaigning from both sides.
