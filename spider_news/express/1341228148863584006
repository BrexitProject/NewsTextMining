 I don’t sign grovelling letters and I don’t sign threatening letters

Tory MP David Davis

“I’m of the view that Cameron should stay on in either circumstance.

“But why should I put that in a letter in somebody else’s words?

“The simple truth is, if we have Brexit, you need stability at home while you did the negotiations.

“As long as he’s sensible about the management of it, he should stay.

“If it’s Remain, I don’t think the question arises. Simple.”

Mr Davis continued: “I don’t like letters to Prime Ministers saying ‘Please stay Prime Minister’.

“To me, it’s rather oily tongue.”

The letter in support of the Prime Minister states: “We who are supporters of Vote Leave and members of the Conservative Party thank you for giving the British people a choice of their destiny on 23 June.

“We believe that whatever the British people decide you have both a mandate and a duty to continue leading the nation implementing our 2015 manifesto.”

Initial indications following the close of polls are that Remain may edge the vote.
