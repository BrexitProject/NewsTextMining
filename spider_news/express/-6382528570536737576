GETTY

Despite pledging to get Britain's finances back on track, George Osborne continues to oversee state spending outpace income by billions of pounds, according to estimates from the Office for National Statics (ONS).The Government borrowed a staggering £17.9billion in the two months since the start of the financial year in April - even more than the same time period last year. It meant Britain's gigantic debt as a share of the economy edged up again in May to 83.7 per cent, with the state now owing an extra £49.6 billion compared to May 2015. The jump in this year's borrowing also puts the Chancellor firmly on track to spectacularly blow his election promises.

Mr Osborne is aiming for a 23 per cent fall in borrowing over this financial year as a whole, as part of his pledge to get Britain back in the black by 2020. The Government has been forced to borrow more as tax income grows more slowly than expected. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: " The slow progress on deficit reduction has been caused by subdued annual growth in receipts of only 3.5 per cent in May, which is down from the recent peak of 4.5 per cent seen in February. "Admittedly, this partly reflects an annual fall in stamp duty receipts – due to an end to the rush to transact ahead of the increased rate on second homes, which came into effect on 1st April. "But it also probably shows the effect of the recent slowdown in the economy."

Mr Bowman added: "The big picture is that the Chancellor has a long way to go in order to meet his fiscal forecasts."
