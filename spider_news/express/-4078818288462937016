Mr Gove decried the opinions of some economists who have predicted that there would be an economic downturn if there is a Brexit.

He says that Britain would thrive if the country is not held back by the tentacles of Brussels.

He called for the country to “vote for hope”.

Mr Gove said: “There are great things that Britain can do in the future as a progressive beacon.

“By voting Leave, we have that opportunity. 

“People should vote for democracy and Britain should vote for hope.

“I can't foretell the future but I don't believe that the act of leaving the European Union would make our economic position worse, I think it would make it better.”

Mr Gove also said that he believed that David Cameron should continue in Number 10 even if he loses the referendum, 

He said: “I absolutely think that David Cameron should stay, whatever the result of the referendum and I hope that he will stay for the full second term which he was elected to serve.”

The campaigning got back into full swing yesterday after being suspended following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox on Thursday.
