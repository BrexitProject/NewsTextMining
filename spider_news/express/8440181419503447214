Christine Lagarde claimed neutrality in the debate over Britain's future in Europe. But urged voters to overlook the flaws of the world, which appears to be a thinly veiled reference to the EU. She said: "It has been said that 'it takes great courage to see the world in all its tainted glory, and still to love it'.

"So I wish bon courage to our fellow Europeans from the United Kingdom!" Ms Lagarde also claimed that it was economically better for the UK to votes to stay in the bloc.

Ms Lagarde also claimed that most British people had benefitted from membership of Europe. She said: "I certainly hope that from our neutral position we can at least shed some light on the economic value of one choice or the other.

And added: "We have reached our determination and certainly concluded that the economic risks of leaving are firmly to the downside."It is just the latest interference from the IMF in the debate over whether Britain should vote in or out in the June 23 referendum.

Last month the Washington-based fund said a Brexit could reduce the economy by as much as 9.5 per cent.And Ms Lagarde added that she could not see 'anything positive' to come out of leaving the EU. The chief also went further and warned British homes to expect a sharp increase in interest rates if it votes out of Europe, which could have a negative impact on households with high debts.
