The telephone study by Ipsos MORI also reveals widespread distrust of the Government's scaremongering campaign, with just a week to go before the European Union (EU) referendum. 

The poll results show 53% of British people now want to leave the 28-country bloc, with just 47% saying they will vote remain.

This marked a huge swing from last month's poll by the same growp, which saw 60% of people choosing Remain and 40% backing Leave. 

It is also the first time Leave has lead the respected poll, commissioned by the Evening Standard newspaper.

The poll revealed only 17% of people believe George Osbourne's claim households would be £4,300 worse off after Brexit, with seven-in-ten people describing it as a lie.

The poll also revealed immigration is now seen as the most important issue in the vote by 33% of people, overtaking the economy which has dropped to 28%. 

However, despite Leave's lead, one-fifth of respondents said they may still change their mind on which way they will vote. 

Gideon Skinner of Ipsos MORI said: “The Leave campaign is getting their messages across, especially on the key public concern on immigration.

"But the Remain camp is finding it much harder to convince people that their core economic messages, both on the risks of Brexit and the benefits of staying, is going to have a personal impact on their lives.”

The Remain campaign's credibility took a big hit yesterday when music icon Bob Geldof insulted fisherman campaigning to leave the EU. 

He interupted a flotilla of Leave supporters and blasted his own music in an attempt to drown out there display. 

The poll used the responses of 1,257 adults who were contacted by telephone from June 11 to 14.
