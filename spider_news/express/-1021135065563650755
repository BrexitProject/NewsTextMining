The UK has brought freedom to Europe, says ANN WIDDECOMBE

PA/ GETTY

The Carlton Club in London was packed with both Remainers and Brexiteers cheering and booing but largely cheering from close of polls till breakfast. As it became clear an announcement was due a complete hush fell on the room and then came scenes of rejoicing and wild jubilation such as I have not seen since John Major won against the odds in 1992.

Quite spontaneously we all began to sing God Save The Queen. We had regained our sovereignty, regained the right to control our own borders and to be ruled by our own elected democracy. Oh, what a night! On Thursday night we learned that Britain had not lost her courage.

Now we need to see that she has not lost her phlegm and that we will know how to stay calm and resolute in the face of stock market jitters. There is no plan B said Cameron and for a while we will pay the price of that complacency but City panic and economic fluctuations are not new and we will come through and find a better world on the other side.



Brexit: What to expect next

GETTY

In addition to courage and calm we will need cool determination, to be flinty and unwavering in the Brexit negotiations and to do at once anything for which we need not wait two years. For that reason alone Cameron is right to go. He could never have negotiated Brexit terms with any conviction and he should immediately hand the interim responsibility for that to a Gove or a Boris.

It is not only a question of what ministers say in Europe but of what they say here to galvanise the civil servants and treasury experts into action instead of forecasts of doom. We live in exciting times and once again it is Britain at the heart of bringing freedom to Europe, for assuredly where we have led others will eventually follow.
