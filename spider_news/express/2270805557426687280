Travelex also said online currency orders increased 30 percent from June 14 to June 21.Earlier this week the pound experience its biggest ever one-day rise in six years, as values wilding fluctuate amid changing polls. Money transfer company Azimo said it would suspend operations on the day of the referendum until the currency market settled down on Friday, because uncertainty around the vote made it impossible to guarantee the safety of customers' money.The pound is now sitting at €1.3 and £1.47.
