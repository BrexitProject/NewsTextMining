Pressure is mounting on Mr Cameron after the Remain campaign suffered a devastating defeat on a dramatic night of results.

Nigel Farage has already called for him to stand down and a “Brexit” Prime Minister to replace him.

"He'll be out today.

“He added: "If there is an election in October, he'll be there fighting it. I'm not sure there will be an election, by the way. I wouldn't call one if I was the Tory party. They may do if they get a new leader.

"What Labour voters are saying is 'We don't have enough power in this society. Give some back to us'. It's about lots of things, but crucially, it's about empowerment."

Mr Cameron is expected to make a statement outside No 10 once the result is officially announced in Manchester.

He will attempt to calm markets after the pound crashed through the floor after the nation voted to Leave the EU.

The pound has hit a 35-year low with financial markets around the globe feeling the ramifications of Britain’s momentous decision.
