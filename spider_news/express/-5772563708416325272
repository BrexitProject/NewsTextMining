Germans BEG Britain to vote Remain… and even vow to stop stealing your holiday sun beds

Bild, the most popular newspaper in the country, also vowed to stop making fun of Prince Charles’ ears and reserve hotel sun-loungers for British holidaymakers in the astonishing last-gasp plea.

This comes as Eurocrats across the continent worry that Britain could vote to emancipate itself from EU control.

Sir Geoff’s notorious goal, which put England 3-2 ahead in the 1966 final, a match the Three Lions went on to win 4-2, has fuelled years of argument between German and English football fans.

Video footage from the time leaves it unclear as to whether or not the ball, which initially hit the crossbar, bounced over the line.

But the German tabloid didn’t miss out on the opportunity to poke fun at the British as well.

Another of the offers they made to voters involved stopping using suncream on beaches “out of solidarity with your sunburn”.

And the list of pledges, which began “Dear Brits”, also played on the long-standing British frustration with mass regulations coming over from Brussels.

The report said: “We'll introduce an EU regulation banning a frothy head on beer.”

But the football-related promises didn’t stop with Sir Geoff’s thunderous strike.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at England’s penalty shootout losses in major tournaments, the German newspaper suggested giving the Three Lions players somewhat of an advantage.

It said: “We'll do without a goalie in penalty shoot-outs with you to make it a bit more exciting.”



Other promises included attending the Queen’s birthday, turning clocks back to sync up with British time and sending German national team coach Joachim Löw to guard the Crown Jewels.

And in a final bid to convince the British electorate not to sever ties with the bloc, Bild also offered one more quintessentially British pledge - introducing “tea breaks”.
