Ex-servicemen penned a public letter to voters urging them to vote Leave in Thursday’s crucial vote and reject “undemocratic” Brussels.

The letter, organised by Brexit-backing Veterans for Britain, said: “We never imagined 71 years ago that our country would be in this position.

“Before you cast your vote in the referendum on Thursday, we want you to know that’s not what we fought for!

This is not the first time British veterans have joined the campaign against the EU cabal.

Last month, Falklands war veteran Major General Julian Thompson and former SAS chief General Sir Michael Rose joined a campaign begging retired and serving military personnel to back a Brexit.
