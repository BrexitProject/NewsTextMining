European leaders are now resigned to the fact Britain is likely to leave the union on June 23, but a diplomat sent a last-ditch provoking message to Britain, claiming it will no longer be needed.

The ambassador warned the UK not to amplify its own importance in the future of the bureaucratic bloc.

He said: "We have had referendums in Denmark, there is one in Italy in October, all of these are existential crises and concern key issues. This is nothing new. The UK referendum is one of many.

"We wish and pray that it goes well, and that Britain stays, but we are expecting the worst. The likelihood is that things will go wrong, rather than go well. Life will have to go on afterwards."

The bloc will pull in new member states as a result of a Brexit, according to the diplomat.

He added: "The EU will have found an identity and will have moved forward, deepening in key areas like monetary union and defence.

The source branded Britain “not a player” in core areas of the EU and the Brussels club will "be better to have a reluctant player outside the tent”.

He told the Telegraph: “Britain already sits at the table and in most core areas, you are not a player.

"In other areas we wish you were a player, but you are hardly present. Some might say it will be better to have a reluctant player outside the tent."

The diplomat went on to blame David Cameron if Britain does opt out of the continental pack.

The source then said the EU has helped the UK and that other EU countries "hold a grudge" for how much the union has given Britain.

He said: "Ask any lawyer, what we gave Britain was outside the treaties, it’s illegal but we did it to help Britain.

"We were more than generous."
