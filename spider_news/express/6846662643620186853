UKIP advertising campaign sends a message that we are better OUT, says NIGEL FARAGE

GETTY

As you will see from today's advert, the EU has failed us all. The disastrous common asylum policy was compounded by Angela Merkel last summer saying all are welcome to come to Europe.

The failure of EU policy now affects everyone and the Eurosceptic debate is on the rise in all countries.

Over the next week I will be unveiling day by day a series of hard-hitting images which I believe will connect with the British public and no doubt rattle the establishment.

All we need to win this referendum is to tell the truth, to remind people of the realities that the irresponsible free movement policies within the EU have had on people's quality of life.

I believe that by making these connections via newspaper advertising, billboards, poster trucks, online advertising and word of mouth this campaign may be enough to get us over the line.

UKIP



It is a message that says we can do better than this, provided we have the guts to ignore our rulers and stand up for ourselves and ordinary people next Thursday.

Day by day Express readers will see these images and don't be afraid to share them to convince your friends and family that we have the chance in a week for our own Independence Day that we must take.
