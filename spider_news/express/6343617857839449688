'A very, very, VERY bad mistake' Remain Tory blasts those who mocked economic warnings

2016-06-24

Following the stunning decision of the country to vote for a Brexit, financial markets have reacted with extreme volatility.

The pound has crashed to historic lows and the FTSE 100 had over £100billion wiped off at market open.

Speaking on the BBC, Anna Soubry hit back at those who accused the Remain campaign of “scaremongering”.

She said: “Yesterday we were told this was scaremongering, and here we are. Can you believe it this morning.

 We have made a very, very very bad mistake

“Actually talking about this economy which is now in this shock.

“And people like me were told ‘You are scaremongering, we don’t want to listen to the experts’.

“I’m sorry but all that is now being, unfortunately, God I wish it were different, proved to be accurate.

“We have made a very, very very bad mistake.”

Lord Tebbit, who served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet, responded to Ms Soubry’s stark warnings, claiming he was not unduly concerned by the shock to the financial markets.

“We envisaged that there would be this sort of reaction,” he said.

He appeared to apportion the blame partly to Chancellor George Osborne for “hyping” up the threat posed by a Brexit.

The fallout from Britain’s Brexit vote has been far-reaching and seismic.

David Cameron has announced he will stand down as Prime Minister.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to provide £250billion of liquidity to banks as they adjust to Britain’s decision to quit the EU.
