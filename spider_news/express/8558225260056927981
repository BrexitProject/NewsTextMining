Councillor Debbie Young was attacked as she sat outside the Leave campaign base in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

The mother and wife said: "I felt something go past my face and then felt something cool on me and heard the shell smash. Then about five or 10 seconds later it happened again.

"It's a strange feeling, does somebody have something against me personally or was their anger at the campaign? We'll never know."

 There is absolutely no need for things like this, to be rude or to be violent

Mrs Young, who represents Stroud and Chalford as a councillor, said the eggs must have been thrown from a distance, possibly out of an open window, due to the speed at which they hit her.

Ms Young added: "You don't have to agree with me, and often people don't in conversation, but that's fine.

"But there is absolutely no need for things like this, to be rude or to be violent."

Mrs Young and her husband Rob are both active Leave campaigners and regularly write about the referendum on social media. 

Before the egging, Mrs Young posted on Twitter: “I've finally discovered why I am #VoteLeave their is a totally intellectual snobbery about #voteremain.”
