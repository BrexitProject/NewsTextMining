The 59-year-old spoke to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain and commented on the constant criticism and the fact that the motoring show hadn't gone down well with viewers.

Despite the remarks hitting headlines around the globe, Kim has since insisted that she stands by what she said.

Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, the actress said: "The joke was the ratings have changed dramatically and I was asked to do it but it didn't work out.

"I said because a lot of people haven't been watching it, I don't think right now is the best time to do it."Â

However, she did insist: "I would love to do it, but if nobody's watching the show maybe I'll wait until things get a bit better."

Kim - who made an appearance at the 2016 Edinburgh Film Festival last week and acted as a juror on the panel for the prestigious Michael Powell Award - has starred in numerous movies and TV shows over the years, but she's best known for playing man-eater Samantha Jones in hit HBO TV series Sex and the City.

She starred alongside Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie Bradshaw), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda Hobbes) and Charlotte York Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) and the girls quickly became four of the most well-known characters in the world.

Fans cheered as Sarah Jessica Parker went on set yesterday for the sequel

Almost 20 years since the series first began, fans of the show are now desperate for another movie, and Kim has said that she's more than willing to reprise her role as Samantha if bosses want to give it a go.

The beauty said: "Of course there should be a third film! I think we would all love it. I mean, what would the story be?"

She added, when asked if she'd be worried about a negative reaction to another film: "To quote Samantha Jones 'if I worried about what every b***h said about me I wouldn't leave the house!'"
