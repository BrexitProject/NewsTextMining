Brexit shock - France 'overtakes UK as world’s fifth largest economy' after pound plunges

2016-06-24

GETTY

In news that will be welcomed in Paris' financial sector, economists say Britain has dropped into sixth place in the wake of a vote for Brexit.

The development will ring alarm bells in the City, coming after ratings agency Standard and Poor's warned it would likely downgrade the country's triple A rating.

Analysis by the London Economic found Sterling's historic fall came as a hammer blow to the UK economy. 

Moody's ratings agency also warned Brexit “heralds a prolonged period of policy uncertainty that will weigh on the UK's economic and financial performance”.

The collapse is deeper than the UK suffered during the Winter of Discontent in 1978, Black Wednesday in 1992 and the most recent 2009 recession when Lehman Brothers collapsed. 

Brexit: What to expect next

Billions were wiped from share values across Europe this morning, with London's FTSE dropping 6 per cent in early deals, Germany's and France's CAC 40 slumping 7.5 and 9 percent and Italian and Spanish markets plunging more than 11 percent.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the central bank was ready to provide £250billion of additional funds to support financial markets after Britain voted to leave.

Sterling is currently trading around seven per cent lower against the dollar at $1.3782.
