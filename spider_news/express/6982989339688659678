WATCH: The seven most BIZARRE moments of the EU referendum campaign

2016-06-22

It has been dominated by doom-mongering claims about the potential impacts of Brexit if voters choose to cut ties with Brussels tomorrow.

And the civil war within the Conservatives has become so bloody that David Cameron could be forced out of Downing Street on Friday.

But there have been plenty of bizarre moments, topped by the 'Battle of the Thames' between Nigel Farage and Sir Bob Geldof last week.

The Ukip leader led a flotilla of fisherman up the Thames last week to highlight the damage caused by EU's fishing policies.

But Sir Bob soon hijacked the stunt by motored up the river on a hired boat screaming "You are a fraud, Nigel" through a megaphone.

In response a furious Mr Farage tweeted: “Multi-millionaire Bob Geldof on the Thames mocking our declining fishing industry EU."

And Vote Leave spearhead Boris Johnson, widely tipped to replace Mr Cameron at Number 10, has taken part in a series of odd photo opportunities. 

The ex-London mayor kissed a salmon at London's Billingsgate Fish Market this morning in a last-ditch attempt to secure a Leave victory.

Mr Johnson has also auctioned a cow, wielded a bunch of asparagus spears and performed 'doughnuts' in a flashy sports car.

The Britain Stronger in Europe campaign scored an own goal with a cringe-worthy advert aimed at young voters last month.

During the video, which is soundtracked by loud dance music, the words "workin, ravin, chattin, roamin" flash up on screen.

Tory MP James Cleverly said mocked the “bad” advert on Twitter, writing: "Clearly someone in their 50s came up with the votin 'youth' campaign."
