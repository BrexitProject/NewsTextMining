'Do whatever it takes to SAVE the euro' Germany approves European Central Bank bond-buying

The European Central Bank (ECB) will now be allowed to buy up debt and prop up the eurozone’s ailing economies, supported by Germany’s central bank.

At the height of the financial crisis, chief of the ECB Mario Draghi pledged to do "whatever it takes" to keep the eurozone's financial structure from imploding.

Plans for a huge bond-buying programme were then launched in 2012, which gave the bank power to buy the debt - and prop-up - the economies of member countries that were about to go to the wall.

However, about 35,000 Germans, including politicians and academics, say the programme goes beyond the ECB's role and is illegal monetary financing that violates German law.

But the court has given the scheme the go ahead and paving the way for the German central bank's participation.

The protest is the latest sign of an increasingly strained relationship between Germans and the ECB.

Earlier this year, Mr Draghi hit out at German politicians who had publicly questioned the ECB's current monetary policy of negative interest rates combined with money-printing.

Amid the frustration of German savers, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the Bank was causing "extraordinary" problems for the country.

He also blamed the ECB for the declining popularity of Angela Merkel's ruling party.

But the ECB is faced with the more pressing problem of a struggling eurozone economy and debt-burdened Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

And Mr Draghi snapped back: "We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the eurozone not only for Germany.

"We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law."
