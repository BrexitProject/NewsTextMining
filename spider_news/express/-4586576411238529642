It is thought many financial firms and institutional investors are expecting a remain and could panic-sell stocks if they wake up Friday morning and find they are wrong. Smaller investors and savers have now been urged to hold their nerve and keep long-term goals in mind no matter which way the market goes. Russ Mould, investment director at platform AJ Bell, said: "There is no doubt that the referendum vote on Thursday is going to cause a spike in trading volumes either way but a Brexit vote could cause an unprecedented dealing day on Friday.

"Our systems are tested regularly to ensure they can handle a spike in volumes but it is not just stockbroker services where blockages can occur.

"Market makers could buckle under the load, which will cause delays for everyone, and trading could even be suspended if the market goes into freefall."

However, Mr Mould caution about trying to time the market.

He added: "Market volatility driven by sentiment rather than company fundamentals is normally short-term and people should not panic or get over excited.

"In the end it is profit and growth that drives company valuations over the long term and people should not lose sight of that when making decisions about their portfolios."
