The 50-year-old believes he could bring some welcome countryside sunshine to the revamped edition of the motoring show, which has been otherwise slammed by critics since launching last month. 

"It would be lovely to take some celebrities out of London and take them on a tour of the countryside to show them what it's all about," he told the Press Association.

"I think we should get a load of tractors on Top Gear with Chris Evans - I'd love to do that."

A Countryfile crossover with Top Gear could bring a much-needed boost to the ratings for Chris and co.'s divisive show.

Week-on-week, the programme has seen viewing figures plummet, with the series opener launching to a respectable audience of 4.4 million viewers,however episode three saw that figure slashed to just 2.8 million. 

In turn, Countryfile has trampled Top Gear on Sunday nights, according to the overnight numbers, which Adam admitted is "absolutely delightful". 

He noted: "And we're producing it on a third of the budget. So I think it's great. I think that Countryfile is really going from strength to strength."

The criticism over Top Gear continued last night, with many viewers on social media blasting Chris' "shouty" performance for a fourth consecutive week.

One particularly disgruntled viewer wrote: "I’d rather watch Romania against Albania while on fire, being fed my own faeces and having to wear a ginger wig than #TopGear.”

Another went one step further, posting: "I’d rather watch Joey Essex, how bad is that?”

A third cried: "I don't even bother watching Top Gear anymore it's so bad I would rather have eye surgery.”

Countryfile airs Sunday nights at 7pm on BBC One while Top Gear follows at 8pm on BBC Two.
