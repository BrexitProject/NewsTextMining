Stanley Johnson backs son Boris to become Prime Minister after Brexit triumph

2016-06-24

The Leave campaigner’s father was impressed by the volume of votes that his son was able to bring in during the campaign. 

Stanley Johnson, when asked about his son’s chances on Sky News, said: “The procedure is the Tory Party will find two MPs elected by the current Tory MPs and then they’ll put those two MPs to the electorate, not the whole electorate just the 100,000 members of the Tory party.

“My point would be this; I think if a man has actually managed to get seventeen and a half million people to vote for his programme, which he did with the other Brexiteers of course, he certainly deserves a place on the shortlist.

“At least his name ought to go forward.”

On Friday morning, after a tumultuous market opening, announced his resignation as Prime Minister in the wake of the public voting to leave the European Union.

The Leave campaign declared their victory after securing 51.9% of the vote – a total of 17,410,742.

As Boris Johnson left his house to attend a central London press conference he was met by a chorus of boos as people voiced their discontent at the Leave campaign’s victory. 

The former Mayor of London is currently the 5/2 favourite with the bookies to take over at No.10 when the Prime Minister steps down in October.
