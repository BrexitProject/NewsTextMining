Johnny Cooke, 35, was left horrified to find the aggressive anonymous note after decorating his car to show his support for his country during the Euro 2016 Championships. 

Patriotic Mr Cooke was out with his fiancee Jessica, 32, son Ben, 7, and 14-month old daughter Laila at Asda in Brackenhall, Huddersfield, when he discovered the note, which he described as “wrong, hurtful and unnecessarily spreading hate”. 

He said: “I was coming back to my car when I spotted a note left under my windscreen wipers. 

“At first I thought someone might have scraped my car, but when I read it I was shocked.

“My son Ben was asking ‘what does to say Daddy?’ so I just had to tell him it was someone being silly.”

The father-of-two decided to shame the mystery shopper by sharing the aggressive note on Facebook, which attracted a flurry of shocked responses. 

He wrote: “Whoever stuck this on my windscreen at the Asda YOU are a disgrace!!

“How is supporting my country & having children who like flags being racist (sic). 

“I was really shocked and upset. Part of me thought it was a joke from someone I know so I put it online to see if anyone knew anything.”

Mr Cooke added: “I think emotions are high with the football and the EU referendum but it’s very hurtful thing to call someone racist. 

“It’s just unnecessary hatred.”
