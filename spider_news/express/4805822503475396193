Almost one in 10 Brits is seeking work outside the country. 

That’s the surprising research from jobs website Indeed, and it’s a higher figure than for jobseekers in China, France and the US. 

The junior doctors contract debacle and a looming Brexit decision could be part of the blame but regardless of the reason, change is underway and some destinations are more popular than most. 

In first place with 37 per cent of jobseekers’ votes is the US, with France coming in a distant second at 11.2 per cent.

Third ranked UAE took a 9.4 per cent share, followed by Canada and Ireland. 

South Africa took out 8th spot with almost 6 per cent clicking on jobs there. 

The Netherlands rounded out the 10-strong list, attracting four per cent of jobseekers. 



1. US 36.5 per cent

2. France 11.2 per cent

3. UAE 9.4 per cent

4. Canada 8.5 per cent

When it comes to Londoners’ choices though, preferences changed significantly.
