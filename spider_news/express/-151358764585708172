The defiant speech saw Farage backtrack on his initial claims that the Remain campaign had “edged” the EU referendum as towns and cities way outside of the London metropolitan elite, like Sunderland, Middlesborough, Wellingborough, and Swindon voted comprehensively to Brexit.

The Ukip leader said: “The Europsceptic genie is now out of the bottle. We now see in Denmark, in the Netherlands, in Italy even, up to 50 percent of their populations want to leave the EU.”

He slammed the fact that two million voters were allowed to register late and asserted it could the the key factor that clinches the result for Remain.

But, in an upbeat mood, the Brexit campaigner said: “Either way, whether I am right or wrong, if we do stay part of this European Union, it is doomed.

"Win or lose this battle, we will win this war. We will get this country back, we will get our independence back and we will get our borders back."

He added: “No, I’m not conceding.”

Farage blasted the Remain campaign’s Project Fear and said “the establishment has scared voters and behaved pretty appallingly”.

Other senior Leave figures declined to back Mr Farage's assessment, which he said was based on information from private exit polls conducted by friends in the City, as well as his personal sense of how referendum day had gone.

But the first result to be announced in the UK gave only a slender lead of 50.7 per cent to 49.3 per cent for Remain in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which had been expected to give a more enthusiastic thumbs-up for EU membership.
