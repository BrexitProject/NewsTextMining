Prophetic Hilda Churchill told son John that there might be an opportunity to vote to leave the “Common Market” and he should use any money she left to help.

Now John, a retired electrical engineer, has remained true to her wishes and spent £2,500 she had saved to campaign for her in local newspapers.

His notices state staying in the European Union would result in a single economy and, eventually, a single country.

 My mum was caring and feisty

The first 7in x 2.5in message cost £400 and appeared in the Western Daily Press on Saturday.

John, 78, of Stroud, Glos, says retired nurse Hilda died in her nineties in 1997.

He said yesterday: “She never really expressed her political views to me – except when it came to this Common Market thing.

“Her feeling was that we never wanted to be in in the first place.

“She said, ‘One day you will be able to use my money to get us out of the Common Market’.

“If there was a referendum which came up, she wanted me to use her money – anything that she left me – for it.

“I'm certain that if she was here to vote today she would vote to leave the EU. That was the grassroots Labour position.

“My mum was caring and feisty. She knew her mind quite well.



“I suppose I could have left the money to the Vote Leave campaign but I wanted to have more control over it.”
