Nigel Farage: £350 million pledge to fund the NHS was a 'big mistake'

2016-06-24

Speaking on ITV just an hour after the Leave vote was confirmed, the Ukip leader said the £350 million figure could not be guaranteed and claimed he would never have made such a promise in the first place.

Asked whether he could guarantee that the money sent to the EU would now go towards the NHS, Mr Farage said: "No, I can't and I would never have made that claim. It was one of the mistakes that the Leave campaign made."

Mr Farage continued: "It wasn’t one of my adverts, I can assure you. I think they made a mistake in doing that. 

“We have a £10 billion, £34 million a day featherbed, that is going to be free money that we can spend on the NHS, on schools, on whatever it is.”

The official Leave campaign had suggested that money saved from contribution to the European Union could be spent on the NHS instead.

Mr Farage was not part of the official Leave campaign and had no involvement with their ads he said.

The pledge was featured on buses, fliers and posters and was central to Vote Leave.

Captions such as "Let's give our NHS the £350 million the EU takes every week" and "We send the EU £350 million a week, let's fund our NHS instead" were stamped on Vote Leave campaign material.

Honing in on his separation from the Leave campaign, the Ukip leader said: "You must understand I was ostracised by the official Leave Campaign and did, as I have always done, my own thing." 

Mr Farage later declared "dawn is breaking over an independent UK."

David Cameron has since announced he will resign as prime minister in October after the British public defied him and voted to leave the EU.

The UK voted by 52 per cent to 48 per cent to leave the European Union after 43 years of membership.
