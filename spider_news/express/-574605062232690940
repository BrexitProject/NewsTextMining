Katie Price says she's 'confused' over EU referendum and admits she's NEVER even voted

2016-06-23

The Loose Women star was among a sea of famous faces in the audience, which included business figures, politicians and entertainers - from Louise Mensch to Tyger Drew Honey.

Katie spoke for many viewers at home but also attracted ridicule when she confessed: “I came here confused and now I’m even more confused.

“I’ve never voted before. I have to vote [on this].”

Admitting that her friends and family are split between Leave and Remain, she went on to explain that her concerns include the NHS - which she relies upon heavily because of her son Harvey.

“I’m just confused. This is making it more confusing,” she added. “I need it in more [straightforward] terms.”

“The fact that Katie Price spoke with the most clarity and she is totally undecided in her vote is what gets me,” wrote one person.

However, someone else said: “Cannot get to terms with the fact that katie price is on the european final debate.”

“I don't want to hear from Katie Price and Theo Paphitis. Shame on C4.  #c4debate no debate,” wrote a third person.

Another post read: “For @MissKatiePrice to say she's never voted before is disgusting. Women died in the fight for women's vote. #c4debate.”

Jeremy Paxman hosted the broadcast, which comes just hours before the polls open.

#C4Debate was the top Twitter trend throughout its time on the air.
