Ann Linde said Sweden is preparing for Brexit due to David Cameron's poor performances in EU referendum debates. 

The minister added she believes Britain will vote to end Brussels rule on June 23 and the volatility emerging in the market will hit the country’s economy hard. 

She claimed around 100 Swedish business in Britain, including three of the country’s major banks, would be put at risk. 

Ms Linde said: “The economic situation will become very uncertain and it will have a negative effect on the market.

“There are about 100 Swedish business, three out of four of [our] major banks have offices there and 100,000 Swedes live in the country. This will effect them directly.”

Ms Linde continued by stating she is extremely worried the Brexit camp will achieve victory due to Prime Minister David Cameron’s poor leadership of the Remain campaign.

 David Cameron’s debates have not gone well

The pro-EU politician said: “We would have a lesser chance to push through the issues we think are important. 

“I’m pretty worried. The Remain camp has stopped using economic arguments and gone on to the immigration issue while David Cameron’s debates have not gone well.”

Ms Linde harsh criticism of Mr Cameron’s performance - which has seen him lose the trust of the electorate - comes after the latest data from search giant Google revealed Britain is on course for Brexit.

Google has revealed how the UK is searching to vote for the upcoming EU referendum on Thursday June 23.

And in terms of search traffic, it is a landslide victory for the Leave campaign.

The research from Google comes hours after a YouGov survey gave Leave a staggering seven point lead over Remain to put the UK in "striking distance" of a Brexit vote.
