#Dogsatpollingstations: Voters take their cute pups to the ballot for EU referendum

The hashtag #dogsatpollingstations is trending again on Twitter as dog owners bring their four-legged friends along to meet up with other canines who have a penchant for politics.  

Perhaps not wanting to miss out on the biggest vote in our generation, pups have padded their way in through torrential rain to accompany their owners while they post their ballot. 

This is not the first time our furry friends have been known to dabble in politics - they were there for the General Election, local elections and now they are back for the EU. 

And they have been clearly brightening people's days away from the wet and windy weather. 

WHAT CAN YOU DO AT POLLING STATIONS?

From big and fluffy to short and happy, canines are certainly not making the voting process a dull one. 

Experts have predicted the decision could see the largest turnout of UK voters in decades, with more than 46 million people eligible to cast their vote. 

Polls opened across the country at 7am this morning and will remain open until 10pm as the nation answers the most important question for a generation.

One added: "I mean, if there is a reason to vote today, it's got to be seeing the #dogsatpollingstations"
