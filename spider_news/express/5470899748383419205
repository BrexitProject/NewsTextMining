Tory MP David Morris dismissed fears the energy giant would launch plans to leave his constituency in response to today’s historic result.

The member for Morecambe and Lunesdale said the company, which owns two nuclear power plants in Heysham employing thousands of people, has committed to its future investment plans.

It will even build another nuclear power plant in the town, he said.

Mr Morris said he secured promises from the firm, which backed Remain in a letter to staff earlier this week.

He said: "EDF confirmed they are not going to change any of their investment plans and are committing to build a third nuclear power station in Heysham. 

 They are not going to be pulling any funding

“They are not going to be pulling any funding.

"It's good news for big business going forward."

Mr Morris has also said he will stand for Prime Minister if his preferred candidate does not run.

He is keeping the identity of the person secret for now, but says it is a man and it is apparently not likely at all that he will run.

If George Osborne resigns, he wants either Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock to be Chancellor, but he would prefer Hancock who is "a very talented economist".

Mr Morris said: "If I don't like any of the other candidates I'm going to run for it myself.

“I have got a preferred person in mind but if he doesn't come forward I'm not going to watch the others go for it."

He would stand on a "centre-left" manifesto and said of David Cameron's ideology and Premiership: "I think the Prime Minister has got it bang on the nail.”

Mr Morris, 50, could not mask his true feelings regarding Boris Johnson, saying: "I regret the pressure he and others have put on the Prime Minister and the situation it has left the country in at this time."
