David Cameron said she would be “missed dreadfully” as the referendum campaign resumed for the first time since her death on Thursday.

He said: “There are events in life that bring our nation together in shock and sadness. The murder of Jo Cox is one of them.

“Jo dedicated her life to the service of others, whether as an aid worker in war-torn countries or an MP in her beloved Yorkshire. She represented the best of Britain – caring, compassionate and tolerant.”

Parliament has been recalled and MPs will return to the House of Commons tomorrow to pay tribute to their fallen colleague.

He told the Sunday Express: “It was an absolutely terrible week last week and I think everybody in politics felt totally winded by the tragic death of Jo.”

Justice Secretary Michael Gove remembered meeting Mrs Cox in her first week as an MP in 2015 as he paid tribute to her.

He said: “She just struck me then as someone who was open and warm and in politics for all the right reasons so I, like everyone, cannot believe we have lost someone so special and in such horrific circumstances.”
