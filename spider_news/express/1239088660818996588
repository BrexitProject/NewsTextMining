Brexit vote: Game Of Thrones 'facing major funding cuts' if UK opts out of Europe

The show, which concludes its sixth season this weekend, will allegedly be deprived of a significant amount of its funding in the event of a Brexit result.

Because much of it is shot in Northern Ireland, HBO benefits from subsidies from the European Regional Development Fund - which it could potentially lose access to, according to FP.

It's of course not the only show that would face a similar setback - but arguably the most prolific, as it enjoys enormous popularity worldwide.

The show's cast have remained largely quiet on social media in terms of the landmark poll, but Ser Jaime Lannister actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau tweeted a photo of two people kissing: one with the EU flag on their face, and the other with the Union Jack.

Iwan Rheon remained impartial but posted: "Tomorrows is on of the most important days in recent UK history. Every vote will count. I urge everyone to have their say and vote #EUref."

Faye Marsay hinted towards an In vote by sharing an article in which David Beckham pledged support for the Remain camp, but would only say herself: "Just visited here - hope you did too" alongside a Polling Station sign.

It has been revealed that last week's episode, Battle Of The Bastards, obtained huge ratings on both sides of the Atlantic, and is also the show's highest-rated instalment on IMDB.
