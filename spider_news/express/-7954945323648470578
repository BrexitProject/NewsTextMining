Paul Hedger told his congregation in Cambridgeshire that God would take an adverse view of the Empire that the European is moving towards becoming.

He said: “All of us would want God's perspective and as followers, once you have God's perspective we have a responsibility as Christians to see it through God's eyes.

“We have to ask ourselves, how would God see it?

He added that God “takes a different view of empires”.

But the sermon, which was delivered last Sunday at Isleham High Street Church in Isleham, dd not go down well with all of those present.

Mr Hedger has been accused  of trying to push his own political views in the name of God.

One member of the congregation, who did not wish to be named, slammed the faith leader an warned that “political issues must be kept away from the church”.

They said: “The congregation was shocked to hear the lead pastor openly campaign for the Brexit camp.

“We go to church to pray and serve God and not be told how to vote in matters that have nothing to do with God.

“God's house is not for campaigning. The decisions we make about political issues must be kept away from the church.

“A person's vote must be their sole decision without any influence from the man of the cloth.”

And Mr Hedger has now hit back at his critics, arguing that it was his “responsibility” to make the case for leaving the EU.



He said: “I see it as the church's responsibility on issues that affect our lives to inform people.

“My aim with what I said was to help them see there may be a higher agenda above what politicians say.

“I think as Christians and as a Christian leader, my responsibility is to help people see things the way God does.

“I would stand by everything I said and a lot of people from our church have been very supportive.”
