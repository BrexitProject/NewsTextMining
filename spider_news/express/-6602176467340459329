The famed property expert - best known for hit programme Location, Location, Location - snapped at Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock after he posted a pro-Remain advert on Twitter ahead of Thursday’s EU referendum.

The Conservative MP for West Suffolk, who attends Cabinet meetings, wrote: “What kind of country do we want to be? For a tolerant Britain vote Remain #StrongerIn”

He also added a pro-EU image urging Britons’ to ‘Vote Remain’, with the advert instructing voters to ‘Remain kind, Remain open, Remain inclusive, Remain tolerant, Remain together’.

But Mr Hancock’s message riled Ms Allsopp, who branded the advert “absurd and divisive”.

Replying to the politician on the social network, the presenter wrote: “This is an absurd and divisive ad, you're no better than Nigel Farage, really shocked.

“It is this kind of attitude suggesting that to want to #Leave is unkind. intolerant & exclusive that people so resent.”

Mr Hancock did not respond to Ms Allsopp’s tweets.

But the former aide to Chancellor George Osborne later spent the evening posting postive tweets about Prime Minister David Cameron’s appearance on BBC Question Time.

Ms Allsopp appears to be undecided over whether Britain should stay in or quit the EU on June 23.

She has previously expressed her “wish” the Queen “could say which way she would vote” in order to offer some guidance.
