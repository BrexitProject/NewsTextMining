Steve Butterworth, who runs the Sportsman pub in Whitworth, Rochdale, was contacted by Lancashire county council who told him to remove the flags on the basis it ‘contravenes the highway code’.

Mr Butterworth put up the bunting the day before Euro 2016 kicked off, but a council official contacted him this week asking him to remove them.

He said: “I put up the three strips of 30m flags on June 11 to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday and for the football tournament.

“But I got a call from the council saying I needed to take it down as it contravenes the Highways Act. I couldn’t believe it.

“I was gutted. I told her that she should send the request over in writing.

“I explained that the drains outside the pub have been blocked and flooding all over the road for the past 18 months but nothing has been done to sort that out. Surely that is more of a problem than plastic flags.

“The flags are not going to kill someone, they are plastic.

“It’s sad it has come to this. There is enough bad in the world and this was just a bit of cheer, but now we are being forced to take it down.”

The flags are attached to the lights outside the pub on Market Street and to trees across the road.

A group of regulars felt angered by the decision too and took a photograph outside the pub sharing their thoughts on the decision.

The picture – which shows the group giving the ruling the middle finger – was posted on Facebook and shared almost 1,000 times.

A council spokesman said: “We’re all for people showing their support for the England team, it’s just that in this case the bunting has been put up over a busy A-road and we wouldn’t want the landlord or the council to be held responsible if it came down and caused an accident.”
