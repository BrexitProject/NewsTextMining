Wolfgang Schäuble has pleaded for a change in policies to stop the organisation from imploding.

The German politician said: "Even if the majority votes to remain, we will not be able to just go on like this. 

"Otherwise people will say 'you still didn't get it'.

"Nothing is self-evident and nothing is so secure that it cannot be endangered." 

But Mr Schäuble didn't give any details on how the 28-country European club should reform. 

The experienced politician admitted "Europe is not in a good state" and that Germany's economy would suffer "considerably" should UK voters decide to leave the EU.

Earlier this month Mr Schäuble warned of a domino effect in the EU of other member states leaving if the UK decides to quit.

The minister said he could not ignore the possibility that other countries might seek the exit door if Britons vote to leave tomorrow. 

Mr Schäuble said: "You can't rule it out.

"How - for example - would the Netherlands, which has traditionally been very closely allied with Britain, react?"

Mr Schäuble has previously said the EU would be able to survive if only Britain left - but would be pushed over the edge if any more countries decided to opt out.



The German finance minister said: "If need be, Europe would work without Britain." 

Mr Schäuble has also threatened to block Britain from the single market if the country votes for a Brexit.

The warning came as Der Spiegel, one of Germany's most influential magazines, dedicated its front page to pleading Britain to stay. 

The magazine said it wanted to make clear "how much the rest of Europe admires" the UK.
