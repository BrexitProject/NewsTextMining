Darren Haines posted an image of a reporter giving a piece to camera from a count in Falkirk, Scotland, on Facebook to make the bizarre comparison. 

People can be seen counting ballot papers at the Grangemouth Sports Centre in the background.

However, in the right-hand corner Mr Haines points out a set of double doors that bear a striking resemblance to the leader of the Nazi Party. 

He wrote: “There is a door in Falkirk that looks like Hitler #bbcreferendum.”

 #HitlerDoor is winning the best #EUref moments so far

Social media users were quick to share his opinion with Mr Haines saying they agreed the doors looked very much like the Fuhrer. 

One posted: “Interestingly enough, there’s a door in Hitler that looks like Falkirk.”

Another added: "#HitlerDoor is winning the best #EUref moments so far.” 

And one joked the door was being guarded by a policeman.

Keen to get in on the joke, others at the EU referendum polling station posted selfies with the door. 

Posting a picture with himself next to it, Andrew Learmonth said: “Found the #hitlerdoor”.
