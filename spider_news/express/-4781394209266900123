With just three days to go before voters go to the polls in Britain, the Republican candidate for America’s presidential election said he would be “be more inclined” to exit the 28-country bloc. 

He said: “I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy.

“But I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion.”

The comments ralling Britons for a Brexit were published in The Sunday Times.

It is just the business mogul’s most recent call to arms to British voters, after previously coming out in support of Brexit last month.

He said then: “I would say that they're better off without it, personally, but I'm not making that as a recommendation — just my feeling.

“I would say that they're better off without it. But I want them to make their own decision.”

He said migration had been “a horrible thing” for the country, adding: “A lot of that was pushed by the EU.”

Over half-a-million people have signed a petition calling for The Apprentice star to be banned from entering the country due to his controversial political beliefs.

He also provoked a critical response when he said: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us.

“They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists.”

He has also been accused of sexmism after claming journalist Megyn Kelly was "bleeding out of her wherever" during a fiesty debate.
