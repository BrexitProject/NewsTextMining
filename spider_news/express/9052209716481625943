News of such a budget triggered a furious reaction from MPs across the board – with over 60 Tories saying they would not support it.

Asked on LBC whether Mr Osborne’s political careers is effectively over, Mr Salmond replied: "I think it is.

"I think he’s now unelectable.

 I think he’s now unelectable

Alex Salmond

"Let’s say it’s a Brexit vote. Then, for reasons stated, Cameron and Osborne are out the next day.

"If it’s a Remain vote, then I can see Cameron getting some leeway… but Osborne has pretty much poisoned the well with a large number of Conservative MPs."

Mr Salmond also confirmed SNP MPs would not support a severe post-Brexit budget like the one Mr Osborne has hinted at.

"I cannot see the prime minister and the chancellor surviving a Brexit vote," Mr Salmond continued.

"Osborne will go with his boss."

The former Scottish First Minister added that he expects Mr Cameron to stay on in a "caretaker" capacity in the event of a Brexit vote while the Conservatives elect a new leader.

Furious Tory MPs have slammed the Chancellor and said his credibility had been destroyed by his plans to inflict a punishing budget on the country.

Sixty-five Tory MPs signed a joint statement opposing Mr Osborne’s plans for an emergency budget.

The statement said: "If he were to proceed with these proposals, the Chancellor’s position would become untenable."
