Each flag represents one of the 28-country bloc's member states. 

A cherry picker was seen removing one of the flags as voters head to the polls to decided whether Britain should remain a member of the European Union. 

The image of the blue and yellow starred EU flag crumpled on the ground was shared on social media, prompting speculation on Brussels' preparations ahead of the referendum result. 

Brussels correspondent Stefan Leifert said: "EU Commission is already exercising how to bring down one of the 28 flags…#Brexitornot." 

The incident comes as the UK expects a record turnout for the historic referendum with 46.5million people entitled to vote. 

Alexander Winterstein, a spokesman for the European Commission, denied the removal of the flag was anything to do with the referendum.

He said: "One of the ropes of one of the flags was damaged and is therefore being replaced.

"The frayed rope was discovered today and repaired immediately."

Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, will not make a statement on the referendum today.

But the politician has been in talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. 

He is expected to speak to French President François Hollande tomorrow. 

But if Britain decides to back Brexit, it's believed the Commission has prepared a one line statement.

Members will simply respond by reportedly saying: “We respect the decision and we regret it."

An EU source claimed the statement was designed to avoid a “cacophony” of reactions, according to American politics website Politico.
