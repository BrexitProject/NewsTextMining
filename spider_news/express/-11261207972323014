Sterling plunged a staggering 11 per cent overnight against the dollar to hit lows of 1.34, after Britain voted to cut ties with the European Union.

At the same time, the pound fell to 1.2 against the euro.

It comes after sterling had been sent to its highest level against the dollar this year as traders predicted a Remain vote would win.

Chris Towner, chief economist at HiFX, said: “The networks are all calling an exit vote and the likelihood of an exit gets to 95 per cent probability.

"Sterling continues to suffer with GBP/USD dealing 10 per cent lower from its high only a few hours ago!"

However, the pound's losses appear to have now been stemmed as traders digest the result.

Mr Towner added: "Arguably the exit vote is now priced into Sterling as the UK wakes up to ‘Independence Day’."

All eyes are now turned to the Bank of England to see what action policymakers will take to prop up the pound and markets.

The FTSE 100 is expected to witness a similar plunge when it opens at 8am, with the market expected to fall by more than 7.7 per cent.
