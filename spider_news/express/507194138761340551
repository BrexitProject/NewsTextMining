'It should be our independence day' Farage calls for national holiday in honour of Brexit

2016-06-24

The date should forever become known as Britain’s independence day, the triumphant Ukip leader has claimed.

Mr Farage has spent much of Friday morning, after a dramatic night, calling for David Cameron to stand down and a “Brexit” prime minister to replace him.

He told the BBC Today programme: “We have broken free from a failing political union.

“The ordinary people have ignored all the threats that have come from big business and big politics and it has been a huge and amazing exercise in democracy.

When asked what he expected to happen next, the MEP continued: “The first thing we have to do is have a government that is committed to Brexit.

“That is absolutely key.”

Following the stunning decision to vote to Leave the EU, the Bank of England has been forced to make a statement following massive volatility in financial markets.

In a statement released on Friday morning after the pound sunk to 31-year lows the central bank said: “The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely.

"It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks.

"The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability."

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has hinted that the Bank of England may have to act to secure the pound if it continues to tumble.
