Jacob Rees-Mogg blasted the way Energy Secretary Amber Rudd repeatedly aimed verbal blows at the former Mayor of London during ITV’s debate last week.

Speaking to Newsnight, he called the tactic “deeply undignified” in a thinly-veiled jibe at the Prime Minister.

Ms Rudd, who was debating for the remain side along with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and shadow cabinet minister Angela Eagle, lashed out at Mr Johnson for his rumoured ambitions to become Prime Minster.

She said: “You need to look at the numbers, although I think the only number that Boris is interested in is the one that says Number 10.

“He’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.”

But the remarks angered Leave campaigners as they accused the aggressive tactic, which is thought to have directly from Downing Street, as being too personal.

Mr Rees-Mogg said: “I wasn’t quite sure whether this was trying to suggest that Boris is a drunk driver or if he’s not safe in taxis.

“Either way I thought it was deeply undignified and a potentially lewd comment for a cabinet minister to make.”

Speaking on the same programme, Nigel Farage suggested that the Leave campaign began to gain ground after adopting his tactics.

The Ukip leader, who is part of Grassroots Out, a different group to the official Vote Leave campaign, said after the change of tactics he “cheered so loudly”.

He said: “The day Vote Leave moved on to talking about an Australian-style points system I cheered so loudly I nearly lost my voice.

“That was the day that the Leave campaign began to get momentum.”
