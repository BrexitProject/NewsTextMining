As campaigns for the referendum enters their final day major sites across the capital were illuminated. 

In Poland, the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw was lit up with Union Jack colours by Polish authorities in support of Britain staying in the EU. 

The Britain Stronger In Europe campaign is preparing for a frantic final day of campaigning this morning and plans to light up the Eiffel Tower and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence. 

 If the United Kingdom leaves Europe, it is forever

Last night the Vote Remain logo was plastered across Edinburgh Castle, the Tate Modern and Millennium Bridge as the BBC hosted a EU referendum debate at Wembley. 

The desperate effort comes as Italian Prime Minister made an emotional appeal to stop Britons making “the wrong choice”. 

Matteo Renzi warned there would be no turning back in the event of Brexit, saying: "If the United Kingdom leaves Europe, it is forever.”

Last week’s Der Spiegel, a leading weekly German news magazine, featured a Union Jack with the headline “Please don’t go” in English and German.

Hungary bought a full page advert in a UK national newspaper in a last-ditch bid to persuade voters to stay. 

But despite the Remain campaign’s hope that European nations want to keep Britain a member of the EU, leading politicians across the 28-country bloc are said to be preparing for Brexit. 



Discussions are already taking place on reshaping the EU after the UK leaves. 

Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has said in the event of Brexit, leaders can use the opportunity to reform the EU. 

France is said to be poised for Brexit in the hope it will allow the nation to take a more central role in the EU.
