The precious metal surged from $1,200 an ounce to reach highs of $1,350 early this morning as traders panicked over the outcome of the referendum.

Brokers said they had seen huge levels of demand from investors looking for a safe place to keep their money.

Gold is traditionally seen as the ultimate haven for money, and reached its highest ever level of $1,900 during the financial crisis.

By lunchtime on Friday, prices had eased to be up five per cent at around $1,320.

Gold's rise came amid a huge fall in the pound, with the currency now sitting at its lowest level since 1985.

Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com, said: "The surging gold price clearly shows the panic sweeping financial markets.

"Gold jumped 22 per cent against the Pound overnight, its fastest ever move, leaping to new three-year highs above £1000 per ounce.

"This is just the kind of crisis which gold helps savers and investors insure against.

"Gold offers certainty and security as stock markets and currencies sink, just as it did during the 2008 meltdown."

The platform saw customers traded around £6.5m of physical gold and silver overnight in more tham 1,500 deals between midnight and 5am.

Gold miners were also some of the biggest winners on the FTSE 100 this morning. 

Despite the stock market collectively falling by around five per cent, Randgold and Fresnillo were up by around 20 per cent and 12 per cent collectively.
