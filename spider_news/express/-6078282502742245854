The Prime Minister, along with his ally George Osborne, has been nowhere to be seen as pro-Brexit votes continue to flood in.

While prominent Leave supporters such as Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith have been giving interviews throughout the night, the Remain camp’s defeated duo have been conspicuously silent.

Disgruntled voters have taken to Twitter to criticise the pair, along with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is also yet make an appearance, for their no show.

Despite one television reporter knocking on his London townhouse door after it became clear Britain had voted for Brexit, the potential future Prime Minister was still nowhere to be seen.

It is understood Mr Johnson will wait for David Cameron to comment before he appears publicly to speak about the Leave victory.

After watching the results come in throughout the night he is said to be resting before travelling to Vote Leave's headquarters later this morning.

Camera crews are gathered at his north London home where Mr Johnson watched the results with his team.

Another Twitter user took to the social media site to demand the Prime Minister makes an appearance soon.

They said: “Where is Cameron? When is he going to address the nation and tell us what the hell he is going to do?”

Another repeated the calls, saying: “Where is David Cameron? He must speak.”
