Bundestag experts have expressed concerns the UK will go unpunished if the people vote to quit the 28-nation bloc during next week’s EU referendum. 

In a secret report seen by a German newspaper, it says experts doubt “whether the United Kingdom would see reason to comply with unwanted EU rules during the transition period”. 

The UK will still retain full EU membership rights for two years in the event of a British exodus of from Brussels while terms of our departure are negotiated. 

But violations of EU laws could be swept under the carpet because by the time a case would reach the European Court of justice, the UK may no longer be subject to its jurisdiction.

Germany has already made it clear that Britain will not go unpunished if it votes to back Brexit. 

The European powerhouse said there will be no second chances for the UK and it will simply be “divorce proceedings”. 

Elmira Brok, German member of the European Parliament Committee, warned the migrant crisis will only get worse. 

It was the latest bout of scaremongering to come from Germany after Angela Merkel waded into the debate headfirst warning Britain it “won’t get a good deal” if it backs Brexit. 

Meanwhile, a poll revealed an overwhelming 80 per cent of Germans are pleading with Britain to remain in the EU.

An overwhelming four out of five people living in Germany do not want Britain to leave Brussels. 

Leave campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove this week announced their ‘post-Brexit manifesto’ and pledged to introduced new laws to end the power of European courts, divert money saved by quitting Brussels into the NHS and halt the free movement of migrants.
