Billionaire investor George Soros, who banked profits of $1billion by famously positioning himself against sterling 22 years ago, said a Brexit-triggered currency fall would be even more destructive.Mr Soros predicted the pound could fall by up to 20 percent, meaning a plunge from current levels of $1.46 to around $1.15.The 85-year-old said: "The value of the pound would decline precipitously. "It would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets, investment, prices and jobs."

Mr Soros made around Â£690million after his infamous bet that sterling was overvalued against the Deutsche Mark, which forced former Prime Minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).This time around, the pound could fall even harder with consequences far more severe, according to the investor. He said: "I would expect this devaluation to be bigger and also more disruptive than the 15 percent devaluation that occurred in September 1992, when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors."It is widely expected the pound would weaken after a Brexit. However, this could actually benefit many exporting businesses and therefore the economy, say Leave campaigners, including Nigel Farage.

Yesterday the pound saw it's biggest one-day rise in around six years, as volatility ramps up ahead of the vote on Thursday. But the Hungarian-born billionaire also warned the Bank of England would struggle to ward off a recession or all in house prices if Britain votes to leave the bloc. Mr Soros added that a Brexit could make some speculators extremely rich but that most people would be left poorer.He said: "Today, there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful."And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters. "Brexit would make some people very rich - but most voters considerably poorer."
