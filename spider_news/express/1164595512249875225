REVEALED: This map PROVES Britain is set for BREXIT in EU Referendum TOMORROW

2016-06-22

Google has revealed how the UK are searching to vote for the upcoming EU referendum on Thursday June 23rd.

And in terms of search traffic, it is a landslide victory for the Leave campaign. And it's not the only data that suggests Leave is on top.

The interactive map breaks down searches for Leave the EU or Stay during the seven days between May 31st and June 7th 2016.

Only 11 county boroughs searched for more terms associated with remaining in the UK on Google during the week-long window, with the rest of the UK favouring searches around the Leave campaign.

The count for the EU referendum will begin at 382 venues across the UK soon after polling stations close their doors at 10pm on Thursday June 23. 

Local and regional results will come in overnight before the national declaration of the result, which is expected at around breakfast time on Friday June 24. 

If Britain does vote to leave the EU, the result will prompt huge celebrations among Brexit campaigners and Eurosceptics across Britain.
