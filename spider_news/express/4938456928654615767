Senior Tory MP Liam Fox: It's essential David Cameron remains as PM

2016-06-24

With the UK voting to leave the European Union, North Somerset MP Liam Fox has highlighted the importance of not adding "political instability into the mix” by losing Mr Cameron from Downing Street.

Speaking on ITV this morning, Dr Liam Fox said: “It’s going to be some time before we leave the European Union and we’ll have a period where we can disentangle ourselves.

"We want to leave on good terms. It’s in our mutual interest to do so.

"We need to have a period of stability and to that end, I would like to see the prime minister today announce he will be staying on so that we don’t add political instability into the mix.”

Questioned on the Prime Minister's vow to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately - the process by which Britain will formally leave the EU - Dr Fox said: "I think that it doesn't make any sense to trigger Article 50 without having a period of reflection first for the cabinet to determine exactly what it is we are going to be seeking and in what time scale.

"If we go through with Article 50 that purposely gives us a window of two years to try and sort out these problems. 

"We will have a number of legislative question to ask for ourselves but I think what is clear is we've now decided to change the course of our history and I hope to also change the course of European history.

"The British people have taken a really courageous view which is to say that managed decline in a failed entity of the EU is not to be our destiny and I'm just overwhelmed by the moment here of enormous historical impact."

The UK has voted by 52 per cent to 48 per cent to leave the European Union after 43 years of membership of Europe's political union in a historic referendum.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage hailed the result as Britain's "independence day."
