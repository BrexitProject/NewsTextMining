The Queen’s biographer Robert Lacey revealed the monarch’s alleged comments and said Her Majesty has also been asking people "why Britain should be part of Europe?"

The revelation was made in a blog for the Daily Beast website.

Mr Lacey said: "And while Buckingham Palace has rightly deplored the impropriety of disclosing Her Majesty’s private remarks, the Palace has been careful not to define her views, nor to deny that her sympathies might, on occasions, like those of many of her subjects, have veered towards Brexit.

“Give me THREE good reasons,' she has, apparently, been asking her dinner companions recently, 'why Britain should be part of Europe?'” 

Buckingham Palace have not confirmed or denied the alleged private canvassing.

Last month The Sun newspaper wrote a headline saying the “Queen backs Brexit” but the press regulator IPSO found that the headline “significantly misled” its readers. 

One royal insider said: "She appears to be asking a question, not making a statement. She is not expressing a view."

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: "The Queen is above politics and acts on the advice of Her Government in political matters.  The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide."

Before the Scottish independence referendum, the Queen asked voters “to think very carefully about the future”. 

Asked about the article, the author said: “The Queen likes a healthy debate around the dinner table. It was just a question.

“She's aware of the complexities for different parts of the UK.

“As we know, she's very careful not to betray whatever her personal opinions may be on this. You can say the same of her husband.”

The polls show that the crucial EU referendum to be held on Thursday is too close to call.
