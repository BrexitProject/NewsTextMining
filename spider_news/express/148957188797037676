Real Madrid's huge Gareth Bale problem following Brexit: How Man United could capitalise

2016-06-24

Bale will now become a non-EU player - of which teams in Spain are allowed just three - and will give Zinedine Zidane a headache.

James Rodriguez, Danilo and Casemiro are Madrid's other current non-EU players.

Madrid had hoped to hand Bale a new long term deal until 2023 but that may have to be put on hold.

The process of leaving the EU will take time but has already created uncertainty with the pound crumbling.

Manchester United have held an interest in Bale since he was at Tottenham and could make a move on the back of Brexit.

Alternatively Madrid could look to sell Rodriguez who has also been linked with United and Chelsea.

Bale, 26, is currently with Wales at Euro 2016 and is the tournament's top scorer.

He moved to Madrid for a world record fee in 2013 and has since won the Champions League twice.
