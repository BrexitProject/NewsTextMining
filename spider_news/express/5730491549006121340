I will not be voting for Cameron again, says Frederick Forsyth

I suppose that was inevitable. It has gone on far too long and the result is frayed tempers. It looks as if the most frayed of all is that of David Cameron. For the past couple of weeks he seems to have changed, as if the old Etonian mask has slipped. He has become more and more frantic. The establishment-crony journalists have blamed the Leave campaign but honestly it was the other way round. 

The Leave speakers tried to concentrate on the issues but the personal affronts and the attempts to rig the people’s choice started and continued from the other side. And if Our Dave’s mantle has slipped, he has no one to blame but himself. He simply has made a litany of foolish errors. There was no need, a couple of years ago, to promise to reduce immigrant numbers to the tens of thousands. With open borders that’s impossible, so of course it failed.

Then he pledged the referendum long before the election. Why? I have heard it said he never thought he would win the May 2015 election outright. The polls said he would have to lead another coalition with the useless Clegg as deputy. And Clegg would certainly block the legislation creating a referendum. So… a pledge he would never have to fulfil. Then he went and won. Another triumph for the polls!

Next he promised personally to reform the entire EU. Wiser heads suggested that was like shifting Mount Everest. So it became a pledge at least to reform Britain’s terms of membership. But even that meant treaty change. So off he set with his begging bowl round the capitals of Europe seeking support. He was rebuffed at every one. 

Back home, the Foreign Office and the coterie of fellow public school chaps who surround him could not accept this. So it was presented as a magnificent triumph and we were told we could confidently remain in a “reformed union”. Problem is it hasn’t been reformed and everyone can see that. So battle was joined on the first big lie. 

Love it or loathe it, the EU is going exactly where it wants to go and that is straight down the road of ever closer union. Now David tells us that doesn’t apply to us. No? What is he going to do about it? We are one against 27. Despite all the boasts, we are at the back of the bus, miles from the steering wheel and with only a tiny fraction of the claimed influence. 



Then he spent £9million, not of donated campaign money but of taxpayers’ money, on a pamphlet that was a tissue of lies and had it delivered to every household in the kingdom. Last week he went too far. He called those who want our sovereignty back “quitters” – a word with the unavoidable inference of “coward” – and people who did not love their country. 

The historical record shows this young man has never put his life on the line for this country, nor gone into harm’s way for Blighty and the only uniform he has ever worn was that of his snooty Oxford dining club. There are almost four million men and women in this country who have worn the Queen’s uniform. By what divine right does he call us cowards and himself the only patriot? 

So I too have made a pledge. Not that I shall never vote Conservative again, just not under the present leadership.

In all the pageantry involved in the Queen’s 90th birthday celebrations last weekend – the marching guards, clattering cavalry, brass bands, flypasts and gold braid – there was one aspect that impressed me most of all. 

It was the crowds. We have spent weeks listening to the EU-worshippers talking this country down. Can’t do this, can’t do that, destined to fail if we leave the “protection” of Brussels. Then the cameras panned over those serried ranks of faces, both in the marching guards and the cheering crowds. 

Black faces, brown faces, faces from the Far East – all radiating affection and pride. Affection for the tiny figure in the silver hair on a balcony at the end of the Mall, and the pride of all those who came, or whose parents came, from far away with one ambition. To become British. Ambition achieved. 

Every ethnicity under the sun, beaming, waving, cheering, proud to be British. And it made me damn proud too. Maybe I’m wrong but it seems to me the real core of those who diminish and denigrate our country and its monarch and flag are the Left-liberal luvvies concentrated in the tiny central area of London. 

They think they are this country but they’re wrong. They dominate the money and the media but the real British are much bigger than the lot of them and on Thursday I hope we prove it.

What is it about football? This worldwide game can inspire extremes of devotion, even obsession and hysteria. No other game seems able to do this and there are scores of sports. But there are two major problems. 

At the top end – Fifa – it is corrupt almost beyond belief. At the bottom end it seems to attract thugs and hooligans such as we have seen shame us all in France. Never mind the Russian Nazis, our idiots were confronting the French police first. 

There is only one recourse and it has to be applied ruthlessly. Photograph, photograph, photograph. Then identify, track down. Then impose a life ban – no appeal. And take away the passport. 

Harsh? Yes, but English football depends on it.

Some years ago in a book called The Kill List, I pointed out that the most dangerous terrorist was not the member of a jihadist conspiracy. These talk to each other, email each other, phone each other. 

They can be eavesdropped, overheard, intercepted, arrested. The most dangerous is the loner, plotting only inside own head. Now a mass murderer in Orlando has proved it. All our technology cannot see inside the human head. 

The majority of the killers slipping into Europe will be like this – trained to plot and murder alone.

The republic of Peru has just had its presidential election and a lady called Fujimori lost to a gentleman called Kuczynski. 

Given that Peru was once a Spanish colony one might wonder that one was clearly descended from Japanese stock (her father was president) and the other must have stemmed from Polish ancestry. 

Were there no Spanish names in the mix? Apparently not. Of course, no real surprise. The most famous product of Peru is a wellington-clad marmalade-eating fellow called Paddington.

We like to think we live under the rule of law. But no one ever asks: “Whose law?” Enormous attention focuses on the glaringly non-democratic EU government in Brussels. 

But no attention is paid to the secretive and sinister EU court. This political body is quietly passing judgments, binding on us all, which transfer power away from London and our Supreme Court to itself. 

Brexit can bring British law back to this kingdom.

The day of the glamour-puss who just happens to be over 40 or even 50 marches on. 

Last week at the Glamour Awards in London an elegant Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders were surely looking better than they did on television all those years ago.
