Google Trends showed the top query directed to the search engine was "What does it mean to leave the EU?"

The third most searched question on the EU was "Which countries are in the EU?", followed by "What will happen now we've left the EU?"

Completing the top five was the search "How many countries are in the EU?"

The questions formed the top Google searches conducted on the EU since the official Brexit result was announced this morning. 

Among Google users based in London, there was also a surge on searches for “Move to Gibraltar”.

Queries regarding Irish passwords and who is eligible for one has also boomed since Britain voted to leave the European Union. 

However, experts have warned not to over-analyse the data, due to the limited information provided by Google. 

Tobias Preis of Warwick Business School said: “It could be the case, for example, that people supporting or opposing the idea of leaving the EU are trying to understand the position of the other party.”

Jonathan Freeman of digital firm i2 Media Research said: “It's pretty unlikely that all those people who are searching for answers will up sticks and move.

“Certainly a lot of people were pretty shocked, it was very close - people would have just been wanting to find as much information as they could.”

The Leave campaign officially won the referendum at around 6am this morning. 

Overall, with all votes counted, 17,410,742 Britons voted to quit the EU with 16,141,241 voting to Remain.

The result prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to step down, Labour to call in a vote of no confidence on their leader Jeremy Corbyn and the sterling to fluctuate in value.
