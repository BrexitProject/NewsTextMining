Gove blasts EU 'JOB-DESTROYING machine' which saw his dad's business close

2016-06-16

Appearing on Question Time tonight, the Cabinet minister said: "I know the EU can destroy jobs – my dad ran a fishing business in Aberdeen.

"The Common Fisheries Policy unfortunately led to the devastation in Scotland – my dad had to close his business.

"Something that had been built up by my grandfather, and maintained by dad, disappeared. My dad suffered."

 The EU is a job-destroying machine

Michael Gove

The Justice Secretary added: "It is also the case there are young people who are suffering in Greece, Portugal and Spain because of the EU.

"The EU is a job-destroying machine and to use a phrase from English literature, that is a tragedy."

Mr Gove was responding to an English literature student who claimed: "I understand how words can manipulate people – all I've heard from you is manipulation."

Last night Mr Gove's father Ernest, 79, appeared to deny his son's claims that the EU destroyed the firm.

He was quoted by the Guardian as saying: "It wasn't any hardship or things like that. I just decided to call it a day and just sold up my business.

"I couldn't see any future in it, so I wasn’t going to go into all the trouble of having hardship. I just decided to sell up and get a job with someone else."



But Mr Gove used the Question Time appearance to claim a Guardian reporter had "tried to put words in his mouth".

He said: "My dad was clear to me – and to the BBC on Sunday – that the business had to close as a result of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.

"I know what happened to me as a schoolboy and I don’t think that the Guardian or anyone else or try to get a 79-year-old man to serve their agenda."
