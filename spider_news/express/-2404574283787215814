The blame game up and running then? Labour MP says Brexit all down to Tory austerity

2016-06-24

The MP for Wallasey claimed traditional Labour voters from communities "stressed and under the most pressure" from "Conservative austerity" for their choice to vote against David Cameron’s government.

The 55-year-old said: "I think it is understandable that those voters, whether they voted Remain or Leave in the communities that are most stressed and under the most pressure from Conservative austerity cuts.

"Many of those are Labour areas and wanted to kick against the whole system.

"The terrible truth is that those people who are most at risk from that pressure; financially, economically, with their economic opportunities in Labour areas perhaps in the North East are now going to suffer if we can’t stabilise the UK economy.

"The Labour Party is the only party that will fight for working class people in those areas.

"Boris Johnson cynically used lies on his campaign bus to say that there’d be £350million extra for the NHS when it’s under pressure from Tory cuts.”

This comes after areas with a strong Labour presence went against their party’s Remain campaign and opted to vote Leave in the historic referendum.
