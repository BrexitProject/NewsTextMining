The Chancellor was accused of trying to scare people into voting to remain in Europe by "peddling phoney forecasts" by Lord Norman Lamont and Lord Nigel Lawson. Mr Osborne has threatened to call an emergency budget in the event of Brexit and impose another sever round of austerity on the Britain. The action was described as "ludicrous scaremongering born of desperation" by ex-party leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Michael Howard with Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson writing in the Telegraph. The UK's economy is strong enough to prosper outside the EU, said the senior Tories, and warnings of economic disaster were "wholly without foundation".

The group also hit out at pro-Remain party members for their behaviour in the referendum debate.They wrote: "There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis."They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain."The Tories also highlighted the problems of the single market and said Britain would benefit from a "managed migration system".



They concluded: "We can remain anchored to a declining economic power with a tottering currency, bound by all the EU's laws, with little influence. This master-servant relationship makes no sense for Britain."Alternatively, on June 23, we have a once in-a-lifetime opportunity to take back control of our economy and our country, to take advantage of the extraordinary potential of the world beyond the EU. We should grasp it with both hands."
