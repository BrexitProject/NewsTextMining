An insider has revealed negotiations on Turkish membership of the bloc will begin just days after the historic EU referendum today. 

Throughout his Remain campaign, the Prime Minister has dismissed fears millions of Turkish citizens could soon get free movement rights to live anywhere in the EU, claiming the country is unlikely to be admitted. 

Yesterday, he told LBC Radio: “The issue simply isn’t going to arise. At the current rate of progress, Turkey could qualify to join in about the year 3000.

“You have to open and close 35 chapters of negotiation. They’ve opened and closed one. 

"People who want us to leave want to pretend this is about to happen any time soon. It isn’t.”

But a Brussels diplomatic source undermined his claim, saying the EU will open new membership talks with Turkey as planned in a few days.

The source said officials from EU nations will meet Turkish counterparts next Thursday.

Former Tory Cabinet minister and Brexit campaigner Iain Duncan Smith angrily accused Mr Cameron of attempting to mislead voters. 

He said: “David Cameron has repeatedly claimed Turkey is not going to join the EU despite it being government policy.

“I’m afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people.” 

Whitehall officials said the reopening of talks was a “technical step” that would not accelerate negotiations with Turkey on EU membership.
