2016-06-24

Mr Hamilton, the Ukip Welsh Assembly group leader, could not hide his joy after the Leave campaign’s historic victory – which has sent shockwaves around the world.

He told the BBC: “I have been working for this for 50 years since I joined the anti-common market league.

“I hardly dared hope that we would actually get to where we are.

“It now looks as though we are going to make it.”

At just after 6:15am on Friday, June 24, the Leave campaign passed the official threshold to ensure victory.

Mr Hamilton’s comments echoed those of his party’s leader Nigel Farage, who, after earlier claiming he thought Remain would edge it.

A jubilant Mr Farage said: “The dawn is breaking on a independent UK. If the predictions are right this will be a victory for the real people, for the ordinary people, and for the decent people.

“We've fought against the multinationals, the merchant banks and big politics' lies corruption and deceit.

"We've done it without having to fire a single bullet but through hard work and graft.

"We've done it not just for ourselves but for the whole of Europe. Let June 23 go down as our Independence Day."
