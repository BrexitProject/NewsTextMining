BREXIT BOOT: Ten of UK’s most distinguished retired military officers call for Leave vote

2016-06-22

They note that the Lisbon Treaty means Britain would be forced to give up its military independence and join an EU Army.

They add: “This gradual process of integration will distort the lines between international cooperation and supranational control until an EU Army exists in all but name - only then, with command structures, logistics and procurement so closely intertwined as to be impossible to unravel, will the European Commission dare to refer to the existence of an EU Army.”

Meanwhile, in a separate intervention retired Rear Admiral Roger Lane-Nott has attacked David Cameron’s claims that world War Three will break out if there is a Brexit vote.

He said: “There are many things wrong with this bizarre statement, let alone the distrust the Prime Minister seems to betray for those who are currently our partners as EU member states.

But the important fact is that it is NATO, not the EU that has been the guarantor of peace in Europe for the last half-century.

“What prevented tension escalating into war was NATO and I know from personal experience that the Cold War was won by NATO and of course the continued presence of a nuclear deterrent which gave the alliance its ultimate strength.”

 The danger here is that motivation behind EU Defence is integration, not Defence

Rear Admiral Roger Lane-Nott

He added: “The danger here is that motivation behind EU Defence is integration, not Defence, and this challenges the primacy of NATO, which has kept the peace in Europe since the War.

“The concept of a unified EU army, navy and air force under one banner is only the end game and will not be finally announced until it’s too late for us to say no. Until then they will carry on doing what they are doing now, that is intensively intertwining our military with those of other EU states.”

Rawlins, Royal Navy Captain Philip Stonor, Colonel Steve Davies, Colonel Ronnie Bradford, Colonel Alan Brown, Colonel Jonathan Campbell-James, Colonel Christopher Hendy, Group Captain Eric King, Group Captain John O’Sullivan, Group Captain Michael Smith and Group Captain Graham Thwaites:

We, the undersigned, have joined Veterans for Britain to add our names to those who have already called for the UK to vote to leave the EU in the forthcoming EU referendum.  It is clear to us that the EU is determined to create its own permanent military force.  Those who argue that this will never happen underestimate the deviousness of the EU elite who have shown repeatedly a ruthless determination to achieve their aims by stealth.

The group have joined some of the most senior former military figures in modern British history who launched Veterans for Britain last month to warn of the dangers to Britain’s security if we Remain in the EU.

Major-General Robin Grist, Brigadier P.P. Rawlins, Royal Navy Captain Philip Stonor, Colonel Steve Davies, Colonel Ronnie Bradford, Colonel Alan Brown, Colonel Jonathan Campbell-James, Colonel Christopher Hendy, Group Captain Eric King, Group Captain John O’Sullivan, Group Captain Michael Smith and Group Captain Graham Thwaites all fear that Nato is being damaged by the EU.

In their letter, they warn: “It is clear to us that the EU is determined to create its own permanent military force.  Those who argue that this will never happen underestimate the deviousness of the EU elite who have shown repeatedly a ruthless determination to achieve their aims by stealth.”

We, the undersigned, have joined Veterans for Britain to add our names to those who have already called for the UK to vote to leave the EU in the forthcoming EU referendum.  It is clear to us that the EU is determined to create its own permanent military force.  Those who argue that this will never happen underestimate the deviousness of the EU elite who have shown repeatedly a ruthless determination to achieve their aims by stealth.

The provisions for permanent and incremental common defence arrangements in the Lisbon Treaty, formation of an EU Military Staff (EUMS), the EU Border Force and the exercising of the EU Battle Group on Salisbury Plain, demonstrate the intent and reality of the integration of the military forces of EU member states.

 This gradual process of integration will distort the lines between international cooperation and supranational control until an EU Army exists in all but name - only then, with command structures, logistics and procurement so closely intertwined as to be impossible to unravel, will the European Commission dare to refer to the existence of an EU Army. At that point, the UK would be powerless to deploy its paper veto, having been overtaken by events.

The defence forces of the UK exist to protect British interests in the world. The EU has already shown that it cannot agree what EU interests are and it is almost impossible to conceive of a timely decision to deploy forces effectively.  By contrast the peace enjoyed in Western Europe since the Second World War is a consequence of NATO, which must be retained and adapted to react to changing threats.

Creating a second military command in Europe would be incredibly dangerous to the UK’s security.

The UK’s interests have historically been and always will be global, reaching beyond Europe to allies around the world. Only by voting to leave the EU will we be able to retain our global alliances, and an independent, full-spectrum military capability under the democratic control of the people of the United Kingdom.

We urge readers to join thousands of Armed Forces veterans across the country, and vote leave on 23rd June.

There are many things to consider as you prepare to cast your vote on Thursday. But there are some sobering things people should pause to consider.

The EU has been a consequence, not a cause of European peace and security.

Yet, ludicrously, the Prime Minister recently tried to assert that leaving the European Union could lead to World War Three. There are many things wrong with this bizarre statement, let alone the distrust the Prime Minister seems to betray for those who are currently our partners as EU member states.

But the important fact is that it is NATO, not the EU that has been the guarantor of peace in Europe for the last half-century.

What prevented tension escalating into war was NATO and I know from personal experience that the Cold War was won by NATO and of course the continued presence of a nuclear deterrent which gave the alliance its ultimate strength.

However, whether the EU and NATO are travelling in the same or divergent directions is the new question we have to ask.

The EU’s insistence on planning its own army, navy and air force poses a distinct danger to European stability if its record is anything to go by, with the EU falling at a number of hurdles in the past when it has tried operations of its own, finally having to give way to NATO to solve the crisis.

This happened in the Balkans conflicts 1991-2013.

When Yugoslavia collapsed, the EU was paralysed by the differing opinions of its members towards the newly-forming states and the outcome was a chaotic and ineffective mess. Serbia was allowed to trample unchecked until NATO stepped in with military force to push Serbian troops back.

In Albania 1997, the UN authorised NATO to launch Operation Sunrise which calmed the situation and restored order.

In the recent migration crisis in the Mediterranean, NATO had to step in to sort it out.

The EU aims to make the UK Armed Forces, Her Majesty's Armed Forces, so intertwined that they are rendered indistinct from other nations' militaries despite technically having the same name.

Our country’s democratic choices on when to deploy our forces, our choice of partnerships, our procurement and operational rules, and the associated budget are now all under the scrutiny of people in the EU Commission and EU Military Staff.

We simply can no longer say that the control of the UK ARMED FORCES IS VIA THE DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THE UK PEOPLE.

The Defence Secretary Michael Fallon pretends, “We have a veto on all EU Defence matters”. This is completely untrue.

12 reasons why you should vote IN or OUT of EU

The Lisbon Treaty removed the UK veto over EU Defence policy, with its obscure but deadly provisions for “permanent structured cooperation”. Article 46 of the Treaty on European Union, permits a subgroup to act in the name of the EU in Defence matters. There would be no obligation to participate, but then you have no veto.

If you join in, with the intention of exercising a veto, then a majority of the participating states can exclude you from the group, if they think your state “no longer fulfils the criteria”, so you lose the veto.

Reports have revealed how this military mechanism is being secretly prepared for use to launch the EU’s new Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, but only after the referendum. This will set up new European military and operational structures.

The danger here is that motivation behind EU Defence is integration, not Defence, and this challenges the primacy of NATO, which has kept the peace in Europe since the War.

The Defence Secretary Michael Fallon pretends, “We have a veto on all EU Defence matters”. This is completely untrue.

The EU federalist politicians in the EU and UK have complete liberty to take us 95% of the way towards common Defence without asking us.

Only NATO has US backing, engages the US in European Defence, leveraging US power to our advantage. Only NATO’s mutual security guarantee matters. A vote to Remain is an implicit agreement to the principle, if not the fact, of an EU Army, Navy and Air Force which is regularly advocated by the EC President Jean-Claude Juncker.

If you are in the Armed Forces you give your allegiance to the Crown. I did that unreservedly and still do.

I just do not believe that any serving or retired UK Armed Forces personnel would accept that and I don’t believe the general public would either!

Undefeated in 400 years the Royal Navy is the most successful fighting force there has ever been. With our colleagues in the Royal Marines, Army and Royal Air Force we have every reason to be proud. All have served this country well.

You tell me which flag you would like to see on Royal Navy ships? The EU flag or the White Ensign.

The only way to restore the primacy of NATO, our own security and the continued future of the Armed Forces under UK control is to Vote Leave and I urge you to do so on 23rd June.
