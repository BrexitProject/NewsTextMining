Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First, said she was "shocked" to hear about the "disgusting" attack on Mrs Cox in Birstall, West Yorkshire.

Eyewitnesses said the MP, 41, was was left lying in a pool of blood after the gunman shot her three times and shouted "Britain First".

Ms Fransen said the claims were "hearsay", adding: "We are keen to verify the comments but we can only do that when the police provide more details."

Eyewitness Graeme Howard, 38, said: "He was shouting 'Britain First' when he was doing it and being arrested. 

"He was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance."

But Ms Fransen claimed "Britain first" was a common slogan being used in the EU referendum campaign by Brexit supporters.

A further statement published on Britain First's website criticised the media for "condemning Britain First for somehow being involved".

The statement, issued before her death was announced, added: "Britain First obviously is not involved and would never encourage behaviour of this sort.

"As an MP and and a mother, we pray that Jo Cox makes a full recovery."

Following news of her attack, Mrs Cox's husband tweeted a smiling photo of his wife posing next to a moored boat on the River Thames.

Brendan Cox, a former advisor to ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, spent yesterday campaigning for the UK to remain in the European Union.

He posted images of himself and the couple's two children travelling along the Thames during a counter-protest against a pro-Brexit flotilla of vessels.
