The risky bettor made the whopping wager of £10,000 in Ladbrokes in Dover on Monday. 

The odds of 12/5 will earn him an amount of £24,000 if luck is on his side and Britain votes for Brexit.









The unnamed gambler placed his bet as the odds were recently slashed on Brexit after opinion polls put the 'Leave' campaign ahead just one week before the referendum on 23 June.
