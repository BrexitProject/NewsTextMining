REVEALED: EU's script in event of Brexit... and it's just ONE line

If the people of Britain back a Brexit during today’s historic EU referendum, members will simply respond by reportedly saying: “We respect the decision and we regret it."

An EU source claimed the statement was designed to avoid a “cacophony” of reactions, according to American politics website Politico. 

Today voters across Britain will turn out to have their say in what has been described as the most important vote in our generation. 

Experts have predicted the decision could see the largest turnout of UK voters in decades, with more than 46 million people eligible to cast their vote.

Polls opened across the country at 7am this morning and will remain open until 10pm as the nation answers the most important question for a generation. 

David Cameron was the first campaign leader to cast his vote in the EU referendum this morning. 

Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon, Michael Gove, Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage have also had their say at polling stations across the UK. 

People in London and south-east England have been forced to wade through floods and torrential downpours to arrive at polling stations to cast their votes.
