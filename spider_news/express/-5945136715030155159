The nation’s biggest daily, Bild, published a story following the referendum in which they blast the British public. 

It claims the UK has “shot itself in the foot” by voting to Leave and that no other European country will be affected. 

They called today - dubbed the UK’s independence day - a black one for Europe. 

But it is not just about the British, they say.

It says Brexit heralds a new era for the populists of other countries, from the leftists in Spain to the right-wingers of the Netherlands. 

No country is safe from their own Brexit moment, they write. 

It says: “There we have it: the British are crazy. They voted, as a majority, to leave the EU and have shot themselves in the foot.

“Should we laugh out of astonishment? Or cry because no European country will remain undamaged? Unfortunately the latter.

“A black day for Europe!”

But they are critical of the EU as well, claiming the vote throws into questions the institution as a whole, which was “not well” before the referendum, but is in mortal danger now.

For the EU to be successful, it will cost money, something the UK was not willing to do anymore. 

Brexit marks a sobering moment for the EU, and is probably the biggest crisis it has faced since its inception.

But the paper says that the EU has failed in its handling of the refugee crisis, and only survived the euro crisis with the help of the ECB.

Bild says it only enforces regulations too feebly, and does so against its own members. 

It adds: “No other country can really feel safe from a 'brexit' moment in their own country.

“It's times to stop the lies. The Brexit pulls away the curtains.”
