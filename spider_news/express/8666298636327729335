BBC guest who voted for Brexit mocked after admitting he didn't think his vote would count

2016-06-24

Despite voting Leave, Adam from Manchester, said he was "shocked" and "worried" by the country's decision to exit the European Union. 

In an interview during the BBC's rolling coverage of the European referendum, Adam told Victoria Derbyshire: "I'm a bit shocked to be honest. I'm shocked that we actually voted to leave.

"I didn't think that was going to happen. My vote – I didn't think was going to matter too much because I thought we were just going to remain.

"The David Cameron resignation has blown me away to be honest. I think the period of uncertainty we're going to have for the next few months has been magnified, so I'm quite worried." 

Unsurprisingly, social media users have ridiculed his sentiment, taking to Twitter to mock his interview.

@ArsendWenger posted: "Adam from Manchester didn't realise voting out meant voting out. Now he's concerned. The average Brit, ladies and gentleman."

@MyFairRosalind said:"Adam from Manchester seems a bright spark."

@Amijesuspablo tweeted: "How stupid are some people? Adam from #Manchester votes to leave but never thought we'd leave and his vote wouldn't count... #adamisstupid."

Worryingly, Adam didn't seem to be the only Brexit voter that regretted their decision.

@TWTaryn shared: "One of my relatives was a Leaver and regretted it by 8am. Vote would be very different this afternoon."

The editor of the BBC programme also tweeted: "With leave voters in Manchester for BBCNews -most told us they woke up thinking "what have I done?" and didn't actually expect the UK to leave."

At 7.25am the official result declared Britain had voted for Brexit by 51.9 per cent to 48.1 per cent.

The Electoral Commission said 72.2 per cent of UK voters attended polling station on Thursday to make the momentous decision.
