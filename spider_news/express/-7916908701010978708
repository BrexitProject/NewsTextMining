Bank of England chief sends ‘aggressive’ letter to Leave MP in row over Brexit comments

Mark Carney claimed Eurosceptic MP Bernard Jenkin had threatened him and misunderstood the independence of the bank.He was responding to Mr Jenkin’s letter that highlighted Britain is now in purdah, which means civil servants must not make public comments that could influence the June 23 vote.

It was thought Mr Carney could try to issue more fear-mongering claims over a Brexit affect on the economy when the Bank gave its decision on interest rates today. The Governor caused outrage and was accused over-stepping his role when he previously used an official update to claim leaving the European Union could push Britain into a recession.

In his letter to the Governor, Mr Jenkin said: "You have already made your views known about the question of the forthcoming referendum."The concern is that you, as governor of the Bank of England, or others who serve the Bank, may have occasion to make further public comment on matters arising from the question on the ballot paper for the referendum."

In a three-page letter to the MP, Mr Carney insisted his economic warnings of Brexit were independent of politics and told Mr Jenkin he had made "numerous and substantial" misconceptions.

The Governor also said Mr Jenkin "demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of central bank independence", adding that it is the Bank's "duty" to report its "evidence-based judgments".

Today Mr Jenkin said Mr Carney's intervention has gone "way beyond what a bank governor would normally do in terms of making statements about rate setting and economic forecasts".He said: "He's reacted very, very aggressive towards me."He's trying to make a distinction that the Bank of England does not run on public funds, even though it's a publicly owned corporation."The advice I have from the Speaker's Counsel is that there appears to be no exemption for the Bank of England."
