Feeling the heat? Alex Salmond brands Farage 'weird' after shock Sunderland result

2016-06-24

A huge win for Leave, couple with a slightly poorer-than-expected result in neighbouring Newcastle, saw the pound plummet as Brexit became an increasing probability.

Mr Farage had earlier in the evening suggested the Remain campaign would “edge it” but has since walked back his remarks.

He told reporters in central London: “Whatever happens tonight, whoever wins the battle, we are wining the war.

“The eurosceptic genie is out of the bottle and it's not going back."

 It's not euroscepticism that's weird, it's Nigel Farage that's weird

“If we fail tonight it will not be us that cracks the first brick in the wall, it will be someone else.”

Mr Farage also said the days of euroscepticism being seen as “weird” were over.

Reacting to the Ukip leader’s comments, Mr Salmond said: “Nigel Farage in his speech said the feeling that euroscepticism was weird is gone forever.

"It's not euroscepticism that's weird, it's Nigel Farage that's weird.

"This was a man who conceded, then unconceded and now he's conceded again. Yet we've only just got the first result.

"He thinks the battle will go on, the war goes on etc. His departure from the political scene would be an excellent thing.

"My advice to Ukip would be ABF – anyone but Farage would be an improvement." 

It is expected to be a long night, with the final result expected to go right to the wire.
