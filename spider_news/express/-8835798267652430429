Half a million have been printed for the firm's 920 pubs in the final days of campaigning. 

The new beer mat has a message on both sides, signed by Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin, and is titled: "Cronyism is bad for Britain - a few questions for George Osborne". 

 Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have tried to fool the public using scare stories from cronies or subordinates

It reads: "Dear Mr Osborne, You say that you won the economic argument. Many strongly disagree. 

"Democracy leads to prosperity and freedom – and the EU is increasingly undemocratic, with awful results in Greece, Spain and Portugal and 15 years' stagnation in Italy. 

"Our European friends are being dragged down by Brussels' bureaucracy."

Mr Martin said: "Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have tried to fool the public using scare stories from cronies or subordinates. 

"Their main economic case relies on these people and their views are not independent or believable. 

"Cameron yet again deliberately uses images of fear and destruction. 

"He is under-estimating the intelligence of the public, who will not swallow this guff."
