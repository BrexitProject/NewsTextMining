The under-fire German Chancellor yesterday said migration from Africa is the "central problem" the crumbling 28-member bloc faces.

She added that the EU "has to focus on Africa", pointing to a relatively slow rate of economic development in some African countries.

And she bizarrely claimed Brussels bureaucrats will "soon" be able to control the number of people arriving from war-torn Syria.

 We Europeans are in a difficult location

Angela Merkel

Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel conceded Europe is in a "difficult location" due to its proximity to both Africa and the Middle East.

The US does not face the same problems because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, she added.

Her comments are likely to be sized upon by Brexit campaigners who say Britain cannot control migration unless it quits the EU.

Last month Mrs Merkel said the EU should hand a staggering €1billion to Africa to stem to flow of migrants influx from the continent. 

She told reporters in Rome: "Either we defend our external borders and we do it together or we risk falling back into nationalism.

"This is not a challenge for Greece, Germany or Italy, but these are challenges that have to do with the future of Europe."

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who met with Mrs Merkel, said he did not care where the money came from as long as a solution was found.

He said: "The important thing is that the migration compact gives resources to help Africa, which is not happening now."

Mr Renzi also attacked Austria’s plans to build a fence at its border with Italy in a desperate bid to tackle the migrant crisis.
