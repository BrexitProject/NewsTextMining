He has spent much of season six locked in a cell in the Sept of Baelor after he was found guilty of a number of crimes against the Faith.

In the images, he can be seen kneeling before the High Sparrow as seven septons sit around him acting as judges.

The news that he would have to stand trial came when King Tommen Baratheon announced that the Crown and the Faith had formed an allegiance and he would not be able to demand a trial by combat.

Meanwhile, Jaime Lannister has travelled to The Twins to see Walder Frey, who makes a return.

In the preview stills, the knight can be seen talking to the Lord of the Crossing but many fans believe that he is plotting something sinister.

Some viewers think that Jaime could be planning a repeat of the Red Wedding and may change his allegiance against the Freys.

North of the Wall, Bran Stark makes a reappearance suggesting viewers may be treated to some more flashbacks in the super-sized season finale.

And over in Meereen, Daenerys can be seen seeking advice from Tyrion Lannister.

The Imp was appointed her royal advisor in season five and as her plans to sail to Westeros begin to fall into place it seems she needs some help preparing for what's next.

In the trailer for episode 10, Tyrion warns her: "You're in the great game now, and the great game is terrifying."

Game of Thrones concludes on Monday on Sky Atlantic at 9pm.
