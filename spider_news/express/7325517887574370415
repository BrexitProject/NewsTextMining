Hopes England can replicate Denmark who rejected EU in 1992 and then WON the Euros

In 1992, the Danish team stormed to an unexpected victory at the European Championships, shortly after its citizens had voted against the Maastricht Treat. 

The referendum was held to determine whether Denmark approved of plans for a re-organised European bloc, and its defeat marked a serious blow to the growing community. 

Just 50.7 per cent of the population opposed the treaty, which resulted in the European Union providing Denmark with four concessions in a new treaty, which was approved the following year. 

Following the historic vote in 1992, the Danish football team stunned the continent once again by winning that year’s championship - and there are hopes England can repeat the feat at Euro 2016.

Despite not actually qualifying for the tournament, Denmark were invited to replace Yugoslavia at the last minute due to the Yugoslav wars. 

They helped to knock England out in the group stages of the tournament before beating Holland in the semi-final and Germany in the final. 

Following the stunning referendum and championship result, the country’s foreign minister boasted: “If you can’t join them, beat them.”

There are hopes this week’s equally historic EU referendum result that could provide the incentive for an England victory.

While the country has never won the European Championships, the symbolic parallels have inspired some fans to believe it can be done. 

After a mixed group stage, in which the Three Lions meekly drew with Russia and Slovakia and squeaked a 2-1 win against Wales, England have now reached the last-sixteen of the tournament. 

A tough road to glory awaits, however, with England placed in the touch side of the draw, along with former champions Spain, France, Italy and Germany.
