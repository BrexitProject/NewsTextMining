With just four days to go before voters decide whether the UK will exit or remain in the European Union, the former London mayor called on the public to back “hope” and vote to Leave.

Speaking at a Vote Leave rally in central London, Mr Johnson said: “We talk up Britain, we believe in our country. That’s the fundamental difference between us and them.

“They say our democracy does not matter and that it’s better to trade it away in exchange for this non-existent economic gain. And we say our democracy is absolutely crucial because we understand the link between democracy and a strong economy. There is a very short time left now. I just urge everyone to believe in ourselves as a country because this country is at its best when we believe in ourselves.

 It is the humane thing to do

“Let us speak up for the hundreds of millions of people around Europe who agree with us but who at the moment have no voice in this debate. Let’s do this thing, let’s take back control and vote Leave.”

Mr Johnson also revived his former policy of an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for more than 12 years, to enable them to work and contribute to the economy.

He said: “It is the humane thing to do. It’s the economically rational thing to do.”

Justice Secretary and fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove told the event leaving the EU would be “a vote of confidence” for Britain.

He also told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show voting Leave “would be an affirmation of faith and hope in Britain”.

He added: “Britain would be taking its place alongside countries like Australia, Canada and America as a self-governing democracy.”
