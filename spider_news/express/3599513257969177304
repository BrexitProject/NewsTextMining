Markus Kerber, head of the BDI group which represents industry in Germany, said it would be “very, very foolish” for the EU to force post-Brexit Britain to pay tariffs.

This comes despite the Prime Minster and Chancellor’s relentless insistence that leaving the bloc will damage Britain’s trade prospects with other EU countries.

Mr Kerber said: “Imposing trade barriers, imposing protectionist measures between our two countries or between the two political centres, the EU on the one hand and the UK on the other, would be a very, very foolish thing in the 21st Century.

“The BDI would urge politicians on both sides to come up with a trade regime that enables us to uphold and maintain the levels of trade we have.”

Reasons to remain or leave the EU

“They would be damaging their own commercial interests if they didn’t.

“That’s why EU politicians would be banging down the door for a trade deal on Friday.”

Former cabinet minister and longtime Eurosceptic MP John Redwood has also joined in with claims that Cameron and Osborne are misleading the British public.

He said: “They know they sell twice as many goods to us as we do to them. Who is going to want to wreck that?”
