The executive chairman of the league claimed Brexit “doesn’t seem to sit very well when you travel the world like we do.”

He added: “There is an openness about the Premier League. I think it would completely incongruous if we were to take the opposite position.”

Reports seemed to suggest Mr Scudamore was speaking on behalf of all 20 clubs in the league.

But the league chief has since been criticised for speaking out on the subject.

Jeremy Hosking, a part owner of Crystal Palace, said he found Mr Scudamore’s comments surprised him.

The part-owner of the London club said if Vote Leave won then Premier League chairman “will not have to content with relentless conflict of interest issues between the Premier League and European agendas”.

He branded Scudamore’s “Europhile” approach surprising, adding: “I wouldn’t be if I was siting on top of a global brand”.

Chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association Gordon Taylor also criticised Mr Scudamore and said Brexit would boost efforts to develop more British footballing talent.

He said a vote to leave would “encourage and motivate club to develop more home-grown talent”.

The news comes after pro-EU West Ham United chief executive Karren Brady warned last month: “Leaving the EU would hurt our leagues, create uncertainty for European transfers and be a step back for the next generation of footballers."

A Premier League spokesman said Mr Scudamore was giving a corporate view that was not necessarily held by every club.
