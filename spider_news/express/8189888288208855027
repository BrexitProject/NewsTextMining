Premier Inn has been hit by tourists and business people avoiding travel following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels.

Consumers have also been more reluctant to spend in the run-up to the EU referendum.

Like-for-like sales at the budget chain slowed to 2.1 per cent from 2.2 per cent over the previous quarter, with revenue per room down 3 per cent in London.

Sales at Costa Coffee stores open at least a year were up 2.6 per cent, following 0.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter.

Chief executive Alison Brittain said it is on track to open up to 250 Costa stores this year around the world as well as between 4,000-4,500 new hotel rooms.

She said: “Although it is early in our new financial year and despite current market conditions, with the benefit of our cost efficiency programme we remain confident of making good progress for the full year.”

Shares rose 67p to 4108p.

DEFENCE group Chemring’s shares were shot down by 17 per cent yesterday as it fired off another profit warning.

The company, involved in cyber protection and producing flares used to counter heatseeking missiles, has already been hit by a delayed ammunition contract in the Middle East, while global defence budgets are being squeezed.

Chemring’s half-year revenue increased by 11.4 per cent to £180.1million, but its pre-tax loss widened from £1.3million to £4million and it warned annual figures would be “slightly below expectations”.

Shares plunged 24½p to 115¼p.

Chief executive Michael Flowers said: “Having strengthened the balance sheet, we are now able to focus fully on the operational priorities that will underpin our future growth.

DEMAND for gold has soared ahead of tomorrow’s EU referendum.

Transactions on the Royal Mint’s online trading platform have jumped 32 per cent since the start of June from the previous month, driving revenue nearly 150 per cent higher.

Sovereign and Britannia bullion coins and Signature Gold bars have been snapped up by investors, who traditionally turn to precious metals in times of uncertainty.

Royal Mint’s Chris Howard said: “We are prepared for possible market turbulence.”

Online exchange BullionVault has seen an 88 per cent rise in trading of gold and silver.

STOCK Spirits has halted its search for big acquisitions and will instead top up returns to shareholders with a special dividend.

The vodka maker said the 10p-a-share payout, combined with its half-year and final dividends, would mean all of its net free cash flow being returned to investors.

Stock had come under pressure to abandon merger deals from near-10 per cent activist shareholder Western Gate.

It had already succeeded in having two nominees elected to the company’s board to bring “renewed energy” to the business.
