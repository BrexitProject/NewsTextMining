Despite overwhelming support in the Rock for the UK to remain part of the Brussels bloc, voters in the UK chose to severe ties with the EU.

The seismic outcome prompted Spain to announce it will seek co-sovereignty of Gibraltar, with acting foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo saying the vote had completely changed Madrid’s outlook on the future of the peninsula.

He said: "It's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time.

"I hope the formula of co-sovereignty - to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock - is much closer than before.”

A spokesman for Gibraltar’s government said the territory’s chief minister would not be commenting on the claims until he addressed the Rock’s parliament at 3pm local time (2pm BST).

Mr Garcia-Margallo said Spain would now push for Gibraltar to stay out of any negotiations with the EU following Britain's exit from the bloc.

Talks over how to manage the land border separating Spain and Gibraltar would be aimed at seeking Spanish control of the peninsula, he said.

A referendum on joint sovereignty in 2002 saw 98.48% of citizens of the territory back remaining British.

Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly in favour of Britain remaining in the EU on a large turnout on Thursday evening, with 95.9 per cent of voters backing the status quo. 

Chief minister Fabian Picardo earlier tweeted: "We have surpassed greater challenges. It is time for unity, for calm and for rational thinking. Together and united we will continue to prosper."
