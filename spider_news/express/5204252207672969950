Her bizarre commentary began when she shared a video clip on Instagram of her Chanel handbag as she watched the results on television.

She captioned it: "#besmart pay attention and work hard to buy @chaneloffocial #remain where's Sunderland? Does Sarah Palin live there? Lol."

Throughout the course of the results, the star has continued to share her views on the referendum on social media.

Following Sunderland's decision to leave the EU, she blamed the city for the drop in the pound.

She tweeted the Independent newspaper: "@Independent why? prove the UK will not trigger anger by allowing (sunderland) to lower the UK pound - THIS IMPACT WILL CONTROL ALL MARGINS."

She added: "good luck with the pound.. will take you about 15 years to get it back up #REMAIN instead."

It appeared that the Mean Girls star was unaware that voting had closed as she continued to list reasons why she thought the UK should remain in the EU.

The 29-year-old shared a link to an article which listed 10 reasons to vote remain in the referendum.

As the results rolled in, Lindsay tweeted that she was unsure of where Kettering and Swindon but was quickly informed of their location.

She politely replied that she was thankful for their help: "@BBCBreaking @BBCWorld @BBCNews thank you for explaining where #Sunderland AND #Swindon ARE... #Remain #EUref."

Her latest tweet on the topic read: "#Remain #besmart #onelone #lovenothate #FREETRADE."

It's clear Lindsay is a big supporter of the Remain campaign along with Benedict Cumberbatch, Rita Ora, HelenaBonham Carter and J.K Rowling.
