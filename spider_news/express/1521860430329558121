Iain Duncan Smith reacts to polls closing – and takes a swipe at Nigel Farage

2016-06-24

Initial indications suggest Remain will edge out Leave in the historic vote, although Mr Duncan Smith said he "genuinely had no indication" which way the result was going to go.

He did admit opposing members of the Conservative Party had "torn chunks out of each other" during the "exhausting campaign".

Speaking to the BBC he said: "I don’t have a sense as we are in unchartered territory here.

"This has been very tight."

The former Tory leader also took a swipe at Nigel Farage, who has said it looks like Remain will win.

 I never quite follow what Nigel Farage says because sometimes he says two different things at the same time

Iain Duncan Smith

He said: "I never quite follow what Nigel Farage says because sometimes he says two different things at the same time."

The Brexit campaigner was quick to mention how he understood there had been high turnout in council estates – which is expected to aid the Leave campaign.

He added: "I have been in politics 24 years now and I don’t think I have seen turnout like this in council estates."

This follows similar comments from fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson who said: "From what I have heard and all the information is that turnout is good in areas where we need it to be."

Data throughout the campaign has shown voters from low-income brackets are more likely to vote to leave the EU than to stay in.

Mr Duncan Smith’s fellow Conservative Chris Grayling was equally reluctant to read too much into early reports.

He told Sky News: "It's much too early, we have no idea what this result is going to be."
