The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said that he was “not optimistic” about Britain staying in the EU after the latest polls.

Polls have revealed an incredible 10-point swing towards Brexit with a week to go. 

Frantic EU chiefs have put in place arrangements for the days immediately after a possible exit vote.

Mr Tusk said: “I know it is very difficult for us to be optimistic today, we know the latest polls.

“But it’s still 50-50, everything is possible.”

Prime minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, said: “We hope Britain stays in the Union. But we have to stay realistic if we look at developments.

“If you’re watching soccer and your team is behind three to nothing in the 90th minute of the game, it’s unlikely that there will be a turnaround.”

Mr Tusk said that the UK can be assured that if it were to vote for Brexit, the EU would be ready.

David Cameron is due to see the 27 other leaders of the bloc at a summit on June 28, five days after the referendum.

Mr Tusk said the cost of Brexit would be really high for economies across Europe and would weaken it in the face of Russian challenges.

He said: “History taught us we were always defeated when divided, and we always won when stood united.”

He went on to say leaving the EU does not make sense seeing as the UK has achieved the position of a key state in the EU.

German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has warned Britain it could be a “third market” , barred from the Single Market.

President of the European Commission has said: “I don’t think the EU will be in danger of death if Britain leaves.

“We will continue the process of closer cooperation in Europe, if not of deepening the EU, and mainly the economic and monetary union.”
