Bernard-Henri Lévi said the French would “probably” abandon the EU if they were given the chance.

The respected philosopher said the EU is clogged-up with bureaucrats who have over regulated everything to the point where there is no longer any room for “dreams or ideas”.

He said: “If there was a referendum in France, they would probably vote for Brexit.

“One of the problems of Europe – which is the explanation for this populist reaction like a Brexit – is that this Europe is not desired any longer. And it does not create desire. This is because the pattern it shows is so sad, so grey, so technical and so technocratic.”

The 67-year-old fears the EU could collapse if Britain leaves.

He said: “My concern will be for both the people of the UK and of Europe.

“I have read articles warning that it could cause a lot of unemployment, and that is a risk.”

Mr Lévy joined the Hexagon Institute, a group for intellectual thinkers from both countries, amid fears that Britain could drift away from France following a Brexit.



He also slammed Jeremy Corbyn for failing to show leadership during the EU referendum.

He said: “I am not all impressed by him… I dislike his absolute lack of concern for real internationalist values.
