Top Brussels chiefs had previously demanded that negotiations take place "swiftly" to secure the UK's exit from the 28-nation bloc.

But the Prime Minister announced in an emotional speech yesterday that he was stepping down in October, where the next occupier of Downing Street can start negotiations with the EU.

And now prominent Brexit backers in the Conservative party have also urged the Prime Minister to push the exit button.

Leading Tory Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin said it was unrealistic to wait until the autumn, saying that talks needed to start "more quickly".

He added: "I think there is a problem just saying 'right, we're not going to do anything between now and October' to address the European Union relationship, because they don't want us hanging around and destabilising all their arrangements.

Brexit: What to expect next

"This is an unprecedented situation, but we are united in our response."

Eurosceptics hope Britain's decision will fuel a domino effect, resulting in a flurry of EU referendums, and an ultimate crash of Europe.

France, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and the Netherlands are also said to be considering turning their back on the European project.
