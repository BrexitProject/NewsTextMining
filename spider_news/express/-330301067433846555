Labour takes the lead in Remain fight as Cameron sidelined from referendum campaign

Jeremy Corbyn’s party has signed a legal agreement with Stronger IN, the official cross-party remain campaign, so it can “piggy back” on Labour’s ground operation across the country. 



On polling day Stronger IN will be operating from Labour’s head office in London in a further signal that David Cameron has been sidelined.

The party was brought to the fore of the campaign last weekend in a bid to win over wavering Labour voters in the North of England.

Last night it was claimed the strategy is working with 70 per cent of Labour voters saying they will vote Remain. 

But John Mill, Chair of Labour Leave, said: “Polling by ORB just last week showed that 42 per cent of Labour voters will vote Leave, and we believe that it could be as high as 50 per cent on referendum day.

“Polling also shows that the proportion of Labour voters backing Leave has been rapidly increasing over the last few months.

“Labour voters and many other left-leaning people from other political parties are now totally committed to vote ‘Leave’.”
