UK borders exposed: Brexit supporter sails ‘refugees’ into Britain to show how easy it is

Startling footage shows the sailor picking up men posing as asylum seekers while his boat is moored in a French port before setting sail for Britain.

The man sails to Folkestone port, where he arrives unopposed and drops off the supposed migrants, who make it onto English soil without any questions being asked by authorities.

 Nobody has sought to stop us or do anything about it, that is how easy it is to bypass immigration to the UK

With the White Cliffs of Dover in the background, the sailor says: “So behind me is the UK, to get here is a two and a half hour trip in moderate weather, no great shakes, an easy feat by anyone’s standards.

“Nobody has sought to stop us or do anything about it, that is how easy it is to bypass immigration to the UK.”

He jokes about setting-up his own business transporting migrants across the Channel, which is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.

The sailor adds: “Nobody is going to stop me, nobody is going to think that this is unusual and it is broad daylight. I can do this whenever I like.”

The video was posted on the Leave.EU Facebook page.

Leave.EU say the passage was made easier by budget cuts to the coast guards and border forces across Britain.

The anti-EU group’s spokesman, Jack Montgomery, said: “David Cameron and Nick Clegg cut £36billion from public spending from 2010-15, hitting our Coast Guard hard.

“Over the same period, £42billion net was handed to the EU. This is the result.

“Slashing border security was a choice, made by politicians who put their loyalty to the EU above the needs of the public.”

The Home Office said it was aware of the video but election purdah rules meant it could not comment.
