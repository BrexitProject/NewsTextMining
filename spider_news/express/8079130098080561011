WATCH: Jeremy Clarkson and James May reveal what they REALLY think about the EU

2016-06-21

The pair - who are currently filming their new Amazon Prime motoring show The Grand Tour - have pledged their allegiance to the European Union and urged the UK to vote remain.

Their reasoning appears to be primarily because being in the EU makes filming their upcoming series easier.

“We are fond of Europe,” May starts at the beginning of the video, pointing to a map of the continent.

"It's annoying really, because I want to remain in Europe, but that means agreeing with him," Clarkson jokes, referring to May.

“We’ve had to set apart our differences,” May confirms. 

"Quite apart from anything else, making our TV show involves touring the world and a lot of Europe,” Clarkson goes on. ”If we weren't in Europe, we would have to get a carnet every single time we wanted to go to one of these countries, and that would take 100 years.”

“What Jeremy is saying is to transport our kit would involve a pile of paperwork that is almost big enough to make a bridge,” May concludes.

The video ends with the pair squabbling over Swiss army knives, following Clarkson’s claim that “Switzerland is a waste of time…which is why we never film there”.

The pair tend to disagree with each other notoriously, as was the case in their Top Gear days, but reveal in the video that they both enjoy the same sandwich spread and prefer the old Ford Mondeo to the new one.

Richard Hammond is notably absent from the video, suggesting he is perhaps in favour of Brexit.

The Grand Tour comes to Amazon Prime in the autumn.
