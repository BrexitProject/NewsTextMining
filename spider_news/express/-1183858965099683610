Top Gear's Matt LeBlanc leaves viewers in stitches with 'fantastic' Brexit joke

2016-06-20

The host left viewers in hysterics when he cracked a joke about the upcoming EU referendum on the motoring show.

While introducing The Stig, who was about to impress viewers in an Aston Martin Vulcan, he joked the driver had little understanding of Brexit.

He teased: "Some say he thinks Brexit is a laxative" as both the audience and co-host Chris Evans laughed.

Before adding: "And for tax purposes he's classified as a biscuit."

Viewers clearly enjoyed Matt's humour, with many taking to social media to compliment him.

One user tweeted: "Brexit is a laxative! The best line on Top Gear tonight so far!"

While another added: "Quote of the week, the Top Gear Stig thinks BREXIT is a laxative."

Someone else continued: "'Some say he thinks Brexit is a laxative, and that for tax purposes he's classified as a biscuit.' Possibly the best #TopGear some-say ever."

However some were far from impressed as one viewer tweeted: "Forget #Brexit, we need a referendum on #TopGear @BBC."

Top Gear continues on Sunday on BBC Two at 8pm.
