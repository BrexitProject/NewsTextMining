The veterans, all over 90, made their appeal when they met Employment Minister and Vote Leave backer Priti Patel at White Waltham Airfield in Berkshire.

The historic location was home to the Air Transport Auxiliary during the war and was the place where the Duke of Edinburgh learnt to fly.

Among those Ms Patel met was former RAF Flying Officer Bryan Neely, 91.

Mr Williams said that “too many people” had died for democracy in this country to lose it to the EU now.

She told them: “You are making a very important point that this referendum campaign is about choice, it’s about freedom it’s about democracy.

“Democracy is something that you who have served and fought for your country all know about.”
