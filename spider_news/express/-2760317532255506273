Goodbye Dave? Bookmakers slash odds on Cameron quitting within the next TWO WEEKS

With just a week until the EU referendum, the under-fire Tory leader is priced at 5/2 to leave Downing Street before the end of June.

William Hill has also cut its odds on George Osborne to cease to be Chancellor by the end of this year – from 7/4 to 5/4.

It comes after 65 Tory MPs vowed to vote against Osborne's proposed "emergency Budget" of swingeing cuts in the event of Brexit.

Vote Leave campaigner and ex-London mayor Boris Johnson is 5/2 favourite to replace Mr Cameron while Mr Osborne is priced at 9/2.

Pro-EU Home Secretary Theresa May and Michael Gove, who made the case for Brexit in a Question Time debate last night, are both 6/1.

Experts predict a staggering £20million will be gambled on the outcome of the June 23 in/out vote across the betting industry.

 The odds have changed several times

But William Hill is still offering 11/8 that Britons will vote to quit the EU and 4/7 that Remain will triumph, despite recent polls showing a massive shift towards Brexit.

Spokesman Graham Sharpe said: "The odds have changed several times during the day but only by a fraction here and there. 

"Every time one side shortens slightly, people back the other side."

Mr Cameron has repeatedly insisted he will remain Prime Minister even if Britons rejected his pro-Brussels campaign.

During an interview on Sunday he said: "If we vote to leave will we carry out that instruction? Yes. Will I carry on as Prime Minister? Yes."

He added that a vote for Brexit would have consequences that would be "very difficult for the Government to deal with".
