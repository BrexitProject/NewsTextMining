Jo Cox would have been 42 yesterday.

The murdered MP has been remembered by Portishead in a stark and moving new video featuring lead singer Beth Gibbons. Their haunting version of ABBA's upbeat SOS was recorded for the film High Rise but has been rededicated to the Labour politician who lost her life last week.

It ends with the words of Jo Cox: "We have far more in common than that which didvides us."

Watch the new video next:

The nation was shocked when Jo Cox was shot and stabbed on June 16. She died later that day in hospital.

The West Yorkshire MP was walking in Birstall, in her constituency of Batley and Spen, when she was attacked by Thomas Mair. The 52-year-old man is believed to have planned the attack in protest against Cox's pro-Europe stance.

A 77-year-old man, Bernard Kenny, was stabbed trying to stop the attack.

Portishead's video carries the hashtag MoreInCommon, in reference to deeply held Cox's beliefs.

Glastonbury has also announced that the officai album this year will be dedicated to Jo Cox.

The version of SOS is Portishead's first official music in six years. The Bristol trio of Geoff Barrow, Beth Gibbons and Adrian Utley released their third studio album, Third, way back in 2008.

Despite rumours of new material in 2009, nothing materialised but the band has continued to tour and play festivals, including Glastonbury in 2013.

Fans are hoping that the ABBA cover version, available as part of the High Rise soundtrack, indicates a return to recording new music.

There are no plans to release the Portishead version of SOS as a single.Â
