Top football agent warns Brexit will weaken Premier League clubs

GETTY

With no special arrangement in place with European Union countries, players arriving from the continent will be subject to the same work permit regulations as those from further afield.

Last summer, that would have meant Leicester failing to sign N'Golo Kante and West Ham not being able to snap up Dmitri Payet. They would not have met the international appearance criteria, along with 332 exempt EU players in the top two divisions of the English and Scottish leagues.

European footballers could now be subject to the same regulations non-EU stars face when trying to enter the United Kingdom, where a player has to make a certain amount of national appearances before automatically qualifying for a Visa

Certainly there is a fear that a Brexit vote might derail the current broadcast gravy train as the Premier League will no longer be able to appeal to European Union lawmakers that sports rights should continue to be sold on a country-by-country basis.

The Football League have gone as far as to write letters to their members promising to get to the bottom of the implications of this vote on their behalf.

Chief executive Shaun Harvey said: "The ramifications of leaving the European Union may prove to be significant for every industry in the UK, including football. However, at this stage, it is fairly unclear what the precise impact will be on the EFL."
