Foreign secretary backs Cameron to remain – minutes before he resigns

2016-06-24

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Mr Cameron had made it clear he "remains the prime minister and will carry out the instructions of the British people."

Speaking on Sky News, Mr Hammond said that voters have "spoken clearly" and the government's job is to "get on with that decision, protecting the economy and doing all we can to get the best possible outcome for Britain."

He said: “The campaign is over. The challenge now is governing the country, bringing the country back together and dealing with the situation we face, making sure that we stabilise  things in the short term and that in the medium term we get the very best solution for Britain. 

“The British people have spoken clearly. The government goes on. We’ve got a broad agenda that we were elected on in 2015.

"We have to deliver on that agenda. It will be more difficult in some areas now but he’s been clear that he wants to carry on and do it.”

But shortly after Mr Hammond's comments the Prime Minister delivered an emotional address on the steps of Downing Street confirming his intention to stand down.



GETTY

Calls for Mr Cameron to resign as prime minister began growing as it began to become increasingly clear Leave would triumph overnight.

Ukip leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage said "dawn is breaking over an independent UK."

The Leave side garnered more than 17 million votes of the ballots cast.

Turnout is estimated at just over 70%.
