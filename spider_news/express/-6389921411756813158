While millions look forward to winding down from a hectic weekend with the smell of their Sunday roast soaring out of the oven, their plans were scuppered as the popular landscape programme - which came under fire for wading into the Brexit debate - arrived in themiddle of the week - thanks to the Euro 2016 football tournament. 

Even the sight of a strapping Matt Baker with a dashing young donkey couldn't sway the scathing audience who complained in their droves on Twitter as dozens lashed out at the BBC for "messing with [their] heads".

"@BBCCountryfile #Countryfile on Wednesday… just wrong! We love Sunday evening TV BBC Please stop messing with schedules!" barked one disgruntled viewer. 

Another moaned: "Has there been a tear in the time continuum thingy? #countryfile is on… I'm f**king confused!"

Reasons we love Countryfile

 BBC Please stop messing with schedules

Two more agreed: "Here we go on a Wednesday night #Countryfile doesn't feel right tho... #JustSaying," and: "#countryfile On a Wednesday is just plain wrong!"

This particularly bewildered social media user added: "#Countryfile on a Wednesday. I am now officially confused, please don't tell me tomorrow is Monday."

A sixth unimpressed fan bellowed: "#countryfile on the tellybox on a Wednesday is just wrong! Even if it has got ponies on it!"

However, others called for the BBC series to keep the divisive Wednesday night slot, as long as they aired another episode on Sunday too. 

"A midweek @BBCCountryfile@BBCOne and one on Sunday would be very popular," suggested one tweeter. 

Countryfile returns to its regular slot on Sunday at 5.45pm on BBC One.
