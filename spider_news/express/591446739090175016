The Brussels bureaucrat also called on voters to use their "common sense" to stay in Europe - despite admitting it's not going to change its ways.

Speaking at a business conference in Greece, the European Commission (EC) President said this Thursday’s vote would be the “biggest decision in a generation” for British people. 

He said: “To turn your backs on your neighbours and retreat into isolation would go against everything that the Europe and UK stand for.”

He added: “To leave would be an act of self harm.”

Mr Juncker said that European nations are stronger and safer together.

He said: "All too often we take for granted what we have built — peace among countries that knew only war, freedom that is guaranteed by the rule of law, prosperity that is built on the planet's biggest internal market, and a way of life that is the envy of the entire world."

In a separate euronews interview when asked how damaging it could be if Britain were to leave the 28-country bloc, Mr Juncker said: “I hope that the British will be led by common sense, because common sense is a British virtue.”

He also said that without Britain the EU “would not change its nature” but there would be a missing element. 

He said: “Without Britain the European Union would no longer be complete and without the British pragmatism, the down-to-earth, the no-nonsense approach the British very often are approving, the European Union would not change its nature but there would be a missing element.”

The Prime Minister David Cameron appealed from outside No 10 for Britain to stay in the EU today. 

There is now less than two days until the much-anticipated referendum which will decide Britain’s future place in Europe.
