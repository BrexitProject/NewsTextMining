'His position is perilous' Pressure continues to mount on 'toast' PM

2016-06-24

With Leave now the favourite with bookmakers, speculation is mounting over the prime minister’s future.

A former Tory Cabinet member has told the Telegraph the Prime Minister is “toast”.

Sir Vince said: “The issue we are now facing is whether the weight of London plus Scotland is sufficient to outweigh everywhere else.

“It is beginning to look like Leave or at best a wafer thin majority for Remain.

“The implications are very, very major… We will probably have a bloodbath in the financial markets.”

 It is perilous

Vince Cable on David Cameron's position

On Mr Cameron he told ITV: "It is perilous [his position]."

He also said the Labor Party had performed abysmally and is faced with the prospect of being viewed as "a London party".

As the likelyhood of a Brexit grows there have been calls for Jeremy Corbyn to stand down.

Former Labour minister Ian Lucas warned the party needs a "big change in its approach".

He tweeted: "Very pleased Referendum campaign over. Whatever the result, Labour needs a big change in its approach."

Leave campaigner and Labour MP Kate Hoey said: "We will find thousands and thousands of Labour supporters abandoning the Labour view on this because we've known for a long time, being out there, that the Labour Party view on this is out of step with Labour supporters and ex-Labour supporters.

"I’m afraid we'll probably find they will not come back to us after the way the leadership have fought this campaign of staying in."
