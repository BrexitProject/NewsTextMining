Critics claim joining the EU forced Britain to surrender control of Europe’s richest fishing grounds to foreign fleets and that its quotas have scuppered many businesses.

Jimmy Buchan, of Aberdeen, who was in the BBC series Trawlermen, said the vote to leave the EU was a “fantastic opportunity for Scotland and the UK to start a new chapter on our relationship with Europe”.

However, Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said the result brought “both opportunities and challenges” for the fishing industry.

Farmers, who get £2billion a year in subsidies from Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy, also gave Brexit a mixed reaction.

Derbyshire farmer Michael Seals of the Farmers for Britain campaign welcomed it.

He said: “The farming industry has clearly indicated it wants change.”

However, ex-National Farmers Union chief economist Sean Rickard said Brexit was “seriously bad news” for British farmers.

He said: “If there’s one group that has really gained from Europe, it’s farmers.”

The NFU, which backed Remain, said: “Our members will want to know the impact on their businesses as a matter of urgency.
