Wonder why? Turks in the UK 'want Britain to REMAIN in the EU'

Turkey has found itself a talking point in the Brexit debate, with pro-leave campaigners warning of a new immigration wave should the country join the European Union. 

While Turkey has been negotiating for membership for more than a decade, its prospects for accession are dimmer than ever amid a government-led crackdown on rights and freedoms. 

The European Union has promised to allow Turks visa-free travel for stays lasting up to three months to the bloc’s Schengen area, of which the UK is not a member. 

Ali Öztürk, a cafe owner in Haringey, London, told the Sabah daily that if the UK stayed a member, the country’s economy would be stronger and more stable.

Around half a million people of Turkish origin live in the UK, many of them from northern Cyprus. 

Immigration, Öztürk added, made the UK more colourful. 

Ali Denizci, a jeweller in Haringey, said there was little information on what exactly would happen following a potential vote to leave the EU.

He said: “We don’t know exactly what England’s staying in the EU or leaving the EU would bring. 

"I don’t think they explained it to the public well enough. In fact, a lot of people are still undecided."
