Labour councillor Ed Murphy, who wants the UK to stay in the bloc, said: “The polls are showing that people who are very poorly educated are likely to vote leave.

“The narrative is quite clear and the analysis has been done, that those demographics are the people who are voting to leave.”

Mr Murphy, a councillor in Peterborough, made his comments on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire this morning.

 I’m not poorly educated and I’m voting to leave

He was criticising trade unionist Brendan Chilton, head of the Labour Leave movement, for sharing a platform with Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

Mr Chilton responded: “Millions of Labour voters up and down the country are going to vote to leave the EU and to write them off as thickies and people of less intellect is the height of arrogance and snobbery.”

MEP Patrick O’Flynn said: “It’s disgusting, snobbery, self-regard and the self-anointed moral superiority of the Remain camp that probably will prove to be its Achilles heel.”

And Mr Murphy, who was on the Paul Stainton Show, faced a backlash from listeners as well.

One caller, Margaret, said: “How dare he say only the poorly educated are voting Leave.

“I went to university but I’m definitely voting Leave.”

Another listener called Keith said: “I’m not poorly educated and I’m voting to leave.”

A man called Frank described himself as well educated and said he had already voted to leave by post.
