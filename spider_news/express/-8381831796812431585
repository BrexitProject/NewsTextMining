Presented by Antoine de Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier, the comical episode of the much-treasured show had fans at home chatting about politics and which way they planned on voting this coming Thursday.

With many social media users proclaiming they missed tuning in for the X-rated programme - which ran from 1993-2007 - discussions quickly turned to more pressing matters.

One person wrote: "The Mrs has never seen #Eurotrash before. I think she's changing her vote out as a consequence."

Another declared: "If #Eurotrash doesn't convince you to vote Remain, then all hope really is lost."

The Mrs has never seen #Eurotrash before. I think she's changing her vote to out as a consequence.

If #EuroTrash doesn't convince you to vote Remain, then all hope really is lost.

"How can we leave a continent where Carla Sarkozy asks you to put your finger up her a***? Political suicide Britain #EuroTrash," someone else questioned.

A further Twitter user proclaimed: "How anyone can vote Brexit after watching #EuroTrash is beyond me."

 While many focused on the political implications of Eurotrash, others confessed to feeling nostalgic about its saucy scenes, confessing that they used to hide from their parents to watch it.

Sex, nudity and fetishes were just some of the subjects explored by the magazine-format series, making for awkward watching with the family.

A viewer admitted: "Feels strange watching EuroTrash with the volume not at 1. #eurotrash."

"It's the first time watching #EuroTrash with the sound up! Can imagine it's the same for a lot of 30-something's!" one other added. 

"Watching #eurotrash with one hand on the remote, but this time in case the kids walk in, rather than my mum," someone else joked.
