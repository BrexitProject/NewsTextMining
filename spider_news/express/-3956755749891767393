European Central Bank preparing for Brexit

President Mario Draghi said the ECB was in “extensive consultations” with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a desperate bid to prevent widespread investor panic in the event of a Brexit. 

Mr Draghi said the Frankfurt-based ECB “is ready for all contingencies” following the UK's decision.

But the Eurozone boss said no plans or no commitments prepared to deal with the consequences of the vote had yet been finalised. 

Italian Mr Draghi said: “It is very difficult to foresee the impact on the various dimensions a vote in the United Kingdom would have on the markets and the eurozone economies.

“We monitor all relevant financial, legal but also political developments."

The Eurocrat said if Britain votes to leave the EU the first priority would be to stabilise the markets which are expected to shift dramatically after the historic decision.

Reasons to remain or leave the EU

Mr Draghi, who vowed to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro at the height of the crisis in 2012, said: “We will closely monitor the evolution of the outlook for price stability. 

"We stand ready to act by using all the instruments available within our mandate, if necessary, to achieve our objective. In particular, the ECB is ready for all contingencies following the UK’s EU referendum.”

His announcement comes as the head of Germany’s biggest lender Deutsche Bank, John Cryan, warned on Tuesday that “the days leading up to and following the referendum will severely test the capital markets”.

Mr Cryan insisted Deutsche Bank are "well prepared" for both outcomes. 

The Eurozone's growth - which has been steadily gaining momentum since the Eurozone crash - remains in the balance as voters wait to go to the polls tomorrow. 

The ECB has long argued that it could not tackle the bloc's economic troubles on its own and has increasingly called for member states to take over some of the burden.
