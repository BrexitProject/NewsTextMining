Joyous Farage admits he feared he would never see Britain become a 'normal' country

2016-06-24

The Ukip leader has been basking in the glow of the Leave campaign’s stunning victory as the UK voted for a Brexit in defiance of the prime minister and his “project fear”.

Speaking to Good Morning Britain, Mr Farage said the behaviour of Mr Cameron and the Chancellor had been "appalling".

Mr Farage told Piers Morgan and Susana Reid he had been “demonised” for daring to talk about immigration.

“I almost didn’t dare to dream that it could happen,” he said. “But it has.”

“It is a victory for ordinary, decent people who have taken on the establishment and they’ve won today.”

To those who opposed the Leave campaign, Mr Farage said: “All it is doing is making us a normal country.

“There are 183 countries out there that have independence days today we became the 184th.

“Normal countries elect their own leaders, make their own laws, have their own courts, control their own borders, that is what normal countries do.”

The Ukip leader was adamant Mr Cameron could not lead the UK’s expected Brexit negotiations with the EU.

He also said the negotiating team must be made up of people who have had some experience of “business and the real world”.

Mr Farage also criticised the decision by the official Vote Leave campaign, of which he was not a part, to promise to spend £350million a week extra on the NHS once Britain leaves the EU.

Morgan then told the joyous Mr Farage he could not claim to be “squeaky clean” following a bitter campaign against the government and Remain.

He replied: “All I have ever tried to do is tell the truth, as I see it, to the British public.”

When asked when he was going to have his first pint of the day, a sheepish Mr Farage admitted “he had already had a couple”.
