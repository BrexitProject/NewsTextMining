GoogleTrends said UK searches for “getting an Irish passport” jumped more than 100 per cent after the Brexit result.

Although no figures were given, most interest came from people in Northern Ireland, with the normally Unionist heartland of Holywood, County Down, taking top spot.

Figures from Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs showed that earlier this month applications from Britain for Irish passports this year were 3,334 – up only slightly from 3,239 over the same period last year.

Officials said numbers fluctuated, but they were only a fraction of what they were from 2007-’09.

However, Neale Richmond, a senator in the Irish parliament, who has two English cousins who recently applied for citizenship, urged passport officials to be ready.

He said: “British citizens with Irish grandparents applying for Irish passports could now move from a torrent to a flood.”
