The former Top Gear host, who had voiced his support for Remain, acknowledged that many people on his side of the row would be feeling immense disappointment - but delivered a call for unity.

Taking to Twitter, he said: "Right. We should have 24 hours of despair and moaning, and then we will all have to roll up our sleeves and make this s**t shower work."

The message soon accrued tens of thousands of Retweets and Favourites.

Other stars have also been reacting to the results, with fellow Remain supporter Hugh Laurie joking: "Congratulations exiters. Reverse is across and down, easy on the clutch."
