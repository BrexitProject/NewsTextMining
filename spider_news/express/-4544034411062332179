Home sellers asking for £100k above sale prices

Vendors have now been urged to set realistic prices for homes or risk their property being ignored by buyers. It comes as the typical asking price in June reached at a whopping record high of £310,471, up 0.8 per cent or £2,320 from May, according to property site Rightmove. Yet the average sale price stood at £213,472, as measured by lender Halifax just three weeks ago. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: "Buyers' affordability is increasingly stretched and they're shopping around so their budgets go further. If you set too high a price your property can become stale and be ignored.""Given that housing markets dislike uncertainty, which could become a reality in the event of a Brexit vote, any dampening of buyer activity might mean that more realistic pricing would be an even more critical factor to achieve a sale."

But despite sky-high asking prices, homes across England and Wales are now taking just 57 days typically to sell, found Rightmove - the fastest recorded since 2010.The quick sales could be as a result of fewer sellers, with many thought to be holding off until the outcome of the referendum on June 23. The number of newly-marketed properties is down by 5.3 per cent compared with the average at this time of year, showed Rightmove data.

How to add value to your home

Mr Shipside said: "In many parts of the country, the over-riding factor of supply outstripping demand has so far overcome buyers' usual reluctance to make major financial decisions at times of political uncertainty.

"Most seem to be getting on with the certainties they can control, namely if you find a suitable property snap it up."He added: "If you're debating whether to trade up and make a big financial commitment you naturally might hesitate before putting your property on the market just a few weeks before you know the vote outcome."
