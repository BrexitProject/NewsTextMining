Bookmakers William Hill said the frenzy of excitement over the looming vote has prompted some people to place bets for the first time. 

They include a woman from central London who has placed her first bet by putting £100,000 on the UK voting to stay. She stands to make £40,000 if the vote goes her way. 

And another woman from Kingston in Surrey has gambled for the first time by staking £10,000 on Leave.

William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe told the Press Association that most people will wait until Thursday to place their bets.

He said: “We are expecting to see a big flurry of betting on Thursday, that's what happened in the Scottish independence referendum.

Reasons to remain or leave the EU

“At the moment the biggest political betting event is the Scottish independence referendum, and that did surprise us because we thought that as it was a two-horse race there would be little interest in it. 

“We are more aware this time around and aren't so surprised in the interest. 

“There is a growing appetite for betting in politics, the Scottish independence referendum showed us that. We saw a similar phenomenon in the general election, the Labour leadership and the London mayor.

“It has spread from a niche market with people in the Westminster bubble the main clients seeking bets, now there is much more interest, people feel much more connected to this event.” 

Mr Sharpe said so far 66 per cent of all the money staked on the EU referendum has been placed on Remain, but 69per cent of all individual bets placed are for Leave. 

William Hill on Monday cut their odds for Remain twice, as they went from 4/11 to 1/3 and then to 2/7 (a 77 per cent chance), while Leave was lengthened twice, from 11/5 to 9/4, then to 13/5 (a 27 per cent chance).
