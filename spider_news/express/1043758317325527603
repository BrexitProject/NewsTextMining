The UK Independence Party leader told LBC radio that it was because he challenges "the establishment" that he attracts such hostility from opponents.

He hoped the referendum outcome would prove the saying popularly attributed to Gandhi that "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win".

"We are being attacked at the moment so I hope we're going to win on Thursday," said Mr Farage.

"I think Leave is going to win - but not by very much."

Europhile Tory former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine told the programme he thought Remain would win as people assessed Brexit risks to the economy.



The peer also told Mr Farage "there will come a time when Britain will join" the single currency "but it's a long way off ... It won't be in your lifetime".Responding to Lord Heseltine's belief the UK would join the euro one day, pro-Leave former Tory Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said: "The mask has slipped, and the IN campaign have admitted that staying in the EU carries huge risks.



"Today they boasted that staying in the EU means deeper integration, financial as well as political. Not least, it will mean the UK joining the Euro - a currency that is currently on the rocks, and has led to youth unemployment rates of up to 50 per cent across the Continent."
