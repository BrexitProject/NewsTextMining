Webb who rose to fame on Peep Show with his partner David Mitchell wrote: “Johnson offers ‘hope’ with clenched fist as a prelude to invoking ‘Independence Day’ to wild applause from thick people.”

Cambridge graduate Webb, 43, then backtracked on his ignorant comment by deleting it and insisting that he was referring to only half of the 6,000-strong audience as “thick”.

He wrote 75 minutes later: “I don’t call them stupid. I called half the Wembley audience stupid for applauding Johnson’s absurd Independence Day peroration…”

The comments were met with scorn on social media.

One called Webb: “Smug and self-satisfied.” 

Another wrote: “You don't have to be an Oxford, Cambridge grad and hold the British public in complete contempt to work at the BBC, but it helps.”

A third commented: “Being accused of idiocy by a luvvie is a bit like being accused of nastiness by Josef Stalin.”
