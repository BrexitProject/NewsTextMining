'An unseemly spectacle' Nigel Farage hits out again at 'chief luvvie Sir YOB Geldof'

2016-06-16

The pair were involved in a bizarre face-off as they and supporters swapped insults across flotillas on the River Thames on Wednesday.

The Ukip leader was leading a number of fishing boats along the river to convince voters to vote Leave and take back control of British waters from the EU.

Geldof has been hammered by Mr Farage for belittling and mocking British fisherman struggling to survive.

He told talkRADIO: "I was trying to give a voice to an industry which has all bet been destroyed by EU membership.

"We’ve given away our territorial waters, and the fish with swim wth them, to be shared with the rest of the European Union.

"I was trying to give them men and women who work in the industry a voice, and the In crowd, upper-middle class New Labour types, with chief luvvie Sir Bob, or Sir Yob Geldof hurling abuse at people trying to earn a living, was an unseemly spectacle.

"I think the image of Geldof making an obscene gesture at some fishermen shouting at him could be the enduring image of the campaign.

"The wealthy establishment who want to stay in the EU because they like to have cheap chauffeurs, cheap nannies, against the working class.

"I think yesterday in many ways defined the battle lines of this referendum."

Mr Farage also warned Germany and France of the dangers of raising trade tariffs against Britain in the event of a Brexit.

He said: "If they want to put out of work hundreds of thousands of Germany carmakers.

"If they want to see vineyards in France going out of business because Britain is not buying their champagne and their wine they can do that.

"And this is the point: we hold the whip hand because we are the customer."

He added: "If they want to have trade barriers with us, it is not Britain that loses, it is France and Germany."
