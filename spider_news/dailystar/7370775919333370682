Marie Buchan, dubbed "Octomum", sparked fury by claiming she would be "forced to work" under government plans to slash the benefits cap.

Now the 34-year-old former lapdancer, who was jobless for seven years until recently, has revealed she is backing the Brexit campaign and voting out this week.

The mum, of Shenley Fields, Birmingham, told Daily Star Online: "I'm voting out of the EU as I think we are overrun already."

She continued: "All these changes have happened for a reason.

"We have no more room, and no money, and no jobs.

"We should be independent."

Marie avoided being evicted from her home despite raking up £4,000 debt in March.

But she claims she already works 21-hour days caring for her kids, scouring eBay and car boot sales for bargains.

Yet the mum was snapped shopping for a £70,000 luxury motor just a few weeks ago.

 “We have no more room, and no money, and no jobs”

The UK is voting on Thursday whether or not to stay in the EU, an economical and political union of 28 countries.

It is the second time Brits have been asked to vote on the issue of EU membership. The first vote was held in 1975, on what was then the European Economic Community.

Brits will know the verdict on Friday morning.
