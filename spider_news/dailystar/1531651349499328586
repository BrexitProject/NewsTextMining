Teresa Hicks, 68, wanted to cast her Leave vote but she claims polling staff told her she was wearing the wrong clothes and so wasn't allowed to cast her ballot.

The grandma-of-two was also draped in a St George's Cross flag and was wearing Union Flag glasses and flags attached to a headband.

The pensioner, from Stevenage, Herts, said: "I was just in the queue and this man came up to me and said 'you are inappropriately dressed' so I asked if they'd send somebody away with a burka on?

"I even offered to put a coat around the poster which I had around my waist but they just said ‘no’.

“I went outside but the same man told me if I didn’t leave leave the premises he was going to call the police.

"I did leave but it wasn’t right.

“I think it’s disgusting.

“Say I was Indian and I was in a Sari would they turn me away? If someone was in a burka would they sent them away?

“I think it was discrimination.”

The retired civil servant was also carrying a homemade Brexit banner, which read "vote to leave the EU".

She added: “I went back a short time later.

“I took the banners off but kept everything else on.

“There were a few people in the queue this time and the same man came over to me.

"He said ‘I told you this morning you can’t come in like that’.

“He went over and talked to some other staff but they let me vote. I can’t believe I had to go through all this just to vote. It’s my right."

Scott Crudgington, returning officer for Stevenage, said: “I understand a resident was asked to leave one of our polling stations in Stevenage today because she was carrying a ‘vote leave’ placard.

“I am sorry if this caused her any distress but it is important that polling stations are kept neutral and free from any campaign material that could influence other voters."
