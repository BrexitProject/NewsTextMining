The West Bromwich Albion winger posted on Twitter today posing alongside Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland.

The Irish footballer captioned the picture "reignition of the flames of reunification" with the hashtages #BorderPoll and #UnitedIreland.

James McClean has previously refused to wear a poppy on his shirt honouring the war dead because of British Army killings in his native Derry.

On another occasion, James McClean turned his back as the UK national anthem, God Save The Queen, was played before a match.

It comes as Northern Ireland and Scotland consider voting on independence from the UK after voting to stay in the EU.

Sinn Féin, the second biggest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, demanded a vote on uniting Ireland as the result was confirmed.

At time of writing, James McClean had closed his Twitter account, where he had posted a number of further photos with Sinn Féin politician Mr McGuinness.

Mr McClean has defended his past actions by saying that he grew up on Derry's Creggan Estate, where the British Army killed six people on Bloody Sunday in 1972.

He has said that he would wear the poppy if it only honoured the soldiers who fought in the two world wars, but it also recognises those who died in the Troubles.

McClean joined West Brom in June 2015 after spells at Wigan, Sunderland and Derry City.
