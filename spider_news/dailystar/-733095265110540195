Travis, 19, who starred on Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole, says he gets up to £12,000 employment allowance and other benefits every year.

Brits go to the polls in the EU referendum tomorrow.

But the teenager, from Sheffield, South Yorks., hasn't signed on for jobseeker's allowance because he is not interested in looking for work.

 “I think we should stay in the EU as, if we stay in the EU, my benefits will the same or more”

He told Daily Star Online: "I don't want to sign for jobseeker's because I'm not actively looking for work.

"I think we should stay in the EU as, if we stay in the EU, my benefits will the same or more.

"I'll still get my benefits. I get between £10,000 and £12,000 a year in benefits.

"The benefits will be the way they are if we stay. They are really helpful. I live alone."

But Travis, who last year wanted the NHS to fork out £15,000 to get new teeth so he could become an actor, added: "My only concern if we do leave is the borders will be quite open.

"I have heard for months all this talk about the EU and until recently I hadn't got a clue.

"Now I am sure we should stay."

In June 2015, Travis said he wanted to have a child with wannabe model Josie Cunningham so he could rake in more benefit cash.

It comes after mum-of-eight benefits scrounger Marie Buchan, who was dubbed "Octo-mum", revealed she is voting out — because "we have no more money and no more jobs".
