The attack took place in Huddersfield near the Waverley Road polling station just days after the brutal killing of MP Jo Cox – 10 miles away in nearby Birstall.

It is not thought that the attack was politcally motivated.

A 19–year-old man has been arrested.

It’s understood that a gang of five men were involved in the incident.

The attack took place at Greenhead Park close to Greenhead College.

The affected polling station was closed for half an hour, before reopening.

The victim – believed to be a teenager – remains in hospital after stumbling to the polling station next to the town's driving test centre.

His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

An eyewitness told the Huddersfield Examiner: “There were armed police on the scene.

“After the stabbing gang members split up in different directions and two ran toward town.

"Police gave chase on foot and arrested two individuals.”

Another witness claimed that a group of men applied pressure to the victim's wound.

It comes just days after a man was seen brandishing a firearm at the town's train station.

The man then ran down the tracks and remains on the run.
