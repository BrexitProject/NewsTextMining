In the description on Ebay, the seller writes: "All the atmosphere, anticipation and ecstasy of 60,000 singing their hearts out – captured forever in this glass jar."

The Stone Roses played a series of gigs at the Etihad stadium in Manchester last week.

The seller says the air was captured at the gig on Saturday and writes: "I swear if you place your ear next to the jar you can still hear a faint reverberation of Squire's solo."

They add the jar comes with a Certificate of Authenticity.

So far, there are 90 bids on the labelled glass capsule – peaking at a massive £65,900.

The auction is due to run until next Sunday, but any Roses fans looking for a cheaper deal can buy jars of the air on the site for as little as £10.99.

Following the massive performances, it was revealed drug dealers were raking it in as revellers attending the comeback gig demanded a massive amount of coke.
