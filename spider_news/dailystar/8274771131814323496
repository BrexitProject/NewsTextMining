The Tory heavyweight yesterday hit out at the Government’s inability to plan for schools and the NHS if Britain remains in the EU.

“If we take back control of immigration we can help local authorities plan for vital services,” he said.

“That will mean young people will have a better chance of getting on the housing ladder and there will be less pressure on school places or the NHS.

“The system is out of control ”

“At the moment the system is out of control and no-one can plan effectively.

“You want to be able to manage your household yourself, you want to be able to manage how things work pretty exactly.”

Mr Johnson stressed parents have to think of their children and their future when they head to the polls on Thursday.

“You’re thinking about your kids and whether they are going to be able to afford a home,” he said.

“That is of great importance. Whether your kids can be part of an economy that is outward-looking and mobilised – able to do deals with growth economies not locked into the EU.

“Where is Britain going? What is it going to be like for us in 20 or 30 years time? Are we going to be part of this very closed system or are we going to take back control and really set our priorities?”
