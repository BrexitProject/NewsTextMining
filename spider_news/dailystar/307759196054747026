Boris for No10? Here's how the next PM will be chosen after Cameron quits

Boris Johnson has emerged as the front-runner although is yet to formally declare an interest in the job.

Home Secretary Theresa May, a quiet Remain campaigner, and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan are also strong contenders.

Mr Cameron's long-time ally, the Chancellor George Osborne, remains a potential successor although the EU vote may have ended his dream of swapping No11 for No10.

Rather than the people, it is the job of Tory MPs and the Conservative Party membership to select the UK's next premier.

Here's how they will do it:

Nominations must be made by Conservative MPs, and if only one is put forward, as could be the case with Bojo, they are duly elected.

If two are received, both names are put to a ballot of party members across the UK.

If three or more people are nominated, then a ballot of the 330 Tory MPs would be held "on the Tuesday immediately following the closing date for nominations" to whittle the pack down to two.

Two candidates will then go head to head in a postal ballot of the wider party membership, which stands at about 149,800 people.

This means the next Tory leader – and Prime Minister – could be elected into office on the votes of just tens of thousands of people.

It will be up to the new leader if they call a snap election to bolster their position, or take over the leadership of the country on the say-so of their party members alone.

To have a General Election the act enforcing five-year fixed term parliaments would need to be repealed after being established under the last coalition government.

The chairman of the 1922 committee, currently Graham Brady, acts as the returning officer in the elections. As such, he decides the date by which ballots have to be returned and the count commences that day.
