Cringe! Kay Burley confuses two black politicians on live TV during EU referendum count

2016-06-24

While reporting live on the EU referendum Kay, 55, asked if the "man in the corner" was MP David Lammy, 43.

But she was corrected by political journalist Beth Rigby – who pointed out the man was actually former Equalities and Human Rights Commission boss Sir Trevor Phillips.

Incredibly, Sir Phillips is 62 — some 19 years older than Labour MP Lammy.

And the embarrassing gaffe sent social media into meltdown.

#skynews Oh Kay Burley - comedy magic as she gets confused and fails to identify Trevor Phillips - she suggests it's David Lammy instead!!

Kay Burley mistaking Trevor Philips for David Lammy bad enough, and then she asks him "do you get that often?" #awkward

The comical blunder came after the polls had closed on the epic EU referendum campaign.

Early on it remains on a knife edge.

In December, red-faced ITV showed pictures of TV chef Ainsley Harriott — when comedian Lenny Henry was being knighted.
