Leave are celebrating success against all odds with a 51.9% majority.

Nigel Farage, 52, had feared "Remain would edge it" at the start of the night. 

But huge turnouts in disgruntled Labour heartlands in the north and Wales pushed the UK towards Brexit. 

And the bold UKIP leader has now heralded the Leave win. 

While just 56% of people bothered to vote in Glasgow – which backed Remain – some Eurosceptic Welsh and north west England authorities saw turnouts as high as 76%.

 “Decent, ordinary people have won”

Making his victory speech, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said "decent, ordinary people have won".

He added: "We have given ourselves a chance to rejoin the world in the 21st century."

He also said the victory was down to Labour voters – even though leader Jeremy Corbyn campaigned to stay in.

"There's still massive discontent with Westminister," Mr Farage said.

The Ukip leader also called for June 23 to be declared a Bank Holiday, saying that it will "go down in our history as our independence day".

The Pound has plunged to its lowest value since 1985 after more and more authorities voted to leave the EU.

Farage gave a defiant speech at around 4am in London after smelling blood for Brexit.

He said: "The dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.

“And today honesty, decency and belief in nation I think now is going to win.

“And we will have done it without having to fight, without a single bullet being fired."

But former Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said: “I think the implications are very very major both economic and political.

“Economically we probably will have a bloodbath on the financial markets.”

Since the shock Brexit verdict was announced, it has been claimed David Cameron is "pondering his resignation" as leader of our nation.
