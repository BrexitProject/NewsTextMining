 “As the big day approaches, the polls are still neck and neck, the pound is experiencing intense fluctuations”

Brits have been flocking to their local post offices and purchasing online as they buy large amounts of both Euros and US Dollars.

Post Office Travel money said branch sales were up by 48.8% on the same period a year ago, while online purchases were up by 381%.

The value of the pound has see-sawed amid the uncertainty over the UK's crunch vote.

Some holidaymakers may be hedging their bets by changing their money ahead of the referendum.

The exchange rate is currently £1 to €1.3.

The Post Office saw a spike in currency sales over the late May Bank Holiday weekend and it said the pattern of growth has continued since then.

A spokesman for the Post Office said: "Currency sales remain buoyant and are up 36% year-on-year for June to date in Post Office branches, online and through purchases on its pre-paid travel money card.

"This rises to a dramatic growth of 154% for currency purchases made online - the majority of this for euros and US dollars."

Despite the surge in demand, the Post Office said it is stocked up and has ready availability of euros for purchase in its branches and online.

Meanwhile, international money transfer specialist HiFX reported the number of holidaymakers buying euros and US dollars has increased by 46% since the weekend.

Chris Towner, chief economist at HiFX, said a prepaid currency card, which people can load with cash now to use abroad, could be a possible option for people wanting to lock into an exchange rate now.

He said: "As the big day approaches, the polls are still neck and neck, the pound is experiencing intense fluctuations."
