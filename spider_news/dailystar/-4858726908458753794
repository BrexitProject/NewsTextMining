The search engine claims "What is the EU?" is the second most searched for question since the results were announced in the early hours of the morning.

"What does it mean to leave the EU?" was the most searched for term relating to the EU, with "which countries are in the EU?", "what will happen now we've left the EU?" and "how many countries are in the EU?" also coming in the top five.

Google Trends also tweeted the EU referendum was the top searched political issue in the US today, coming ahead of gun control, immigration and the economy.

There was also reportedly a 100% spike in UK searches for "getting an Irish passport" after the vote, too.

The UK made the decision to leave the EU, with 52% voting to cut ties with Brussels.

But not everyone is happy with the decision, with calls for a second referendum and even a Twitter campaign set up for independence for London.
