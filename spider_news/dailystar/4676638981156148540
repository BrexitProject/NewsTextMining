Dozens of residents in Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire were unable to have their say after they were told they were not included on the registration list.

Angry residents hit out, describing the situation as a “total shambles” and Central Beds Council eventually made arrangements for voters who had missed out.

Meanwhile flooding has hit parts of London and the South East on polling day for the EU referendum – with the fire service inundated with calls and travel at a standstill.

A rare continental thunderstorm has caused freak weather across Britain as the nation heads to the polls.
