The US Presidential candidate jetted in to open a new golf course in Ayrshire.

But as controversial billionaire Trump made his way to his £200m golf course his arrival was sabotaged by a gang of Mexicans.

The sombrero–wearing musical ensemble formed a wall – a nod to Trump's promise to construct a wall to keep Mexicans out of the US.

Equipped with bricks and instruments, the group – known as Juan Direction – sang songs.

Eventually the group – part of a stunt for Paddy Power – were moved on to by police.

It came just hours after Britain voted to split from Brussels – forcing Prime Minister David Cameron to resign.

A spokesperson for the bookmaker whose recent stunts have included winding up the Russian Embassy, said:

“David Cameron thought he was having a bad day.

"We gave Donald a good Guac-ing with this stunt, and it seems like voters will do the same in the polls."

The bookies aren't the only ones pulling pranks at Trump's expense.

Comic Lee Nelson rolled a bucket full of balls across the green at the course.

These weren't any old balls – as they were covered in swastikas.

Popular tourist attraction – the London Dungeon have also weighed in to the Trump-bashing.

The Dungeon has found the hair-raising businessman-turned-politician Trump guilty of "crimes against fashion".

They expressed their disgust with Trump's unruly comments and have invited the British people to come up with a suitable punishment.

The public are asked to recommend a fitting fine for headline-grabbing Donald.

Brits can do so by heading to the attraction's Facebook page and come up with their suggestions.
