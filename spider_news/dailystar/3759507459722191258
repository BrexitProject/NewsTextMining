Countdown begins to EU D-Day: Brits braced for most important vote in modern times

2016-06-22

Will we press the red button?

Will we say adiós, au revoir and auf wiedersehen to Brussels bigwigs who have a say from everything from the shape of our bananas to how many immigrants shack up here?

Or will we bottle it at the last minute and end up group hugging our continental chums?

GETTY

It is fair to say many of us have a vague understanding – or none at all – about what the EU is all about.

But our membership means a lot more than many people think and voting to leave it would rock the world.

It is a once in a life time opportunity to shake things up big time.

For the EU referendum is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to decide if you want Britain to stay in or to quit the EU and go it alone.

According to pre-referendum polls, it is a nail-biting split between those wanting to remain and those wanting Brexit.

GETTY

It is set to go the wire – don’t expect the bookies to payout much.

Decision day is Thursday and you will be able to cast your vote at your local polling station between 7am and 10pm.

There will be one question: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"

Those wanting a great escape claim staying means immigrants swamping the country and the end of Britain as an independent country.

“You can change the whole course of European history”

In his Monday newspaper column, ex London mayor Boris Johnson has urged voters to seize a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change the course of history.

"Now is the time to believe in ourselves, and in what Britain can do, and to remember that we always do best when we believe in ourselves," he said.

"This chance will not come again in our lifetimes, and I pray we do not miss it.

"You can change the whole course of European history - and if you vote Leave, I believe that change will be overwhelmingly positive."

If they win David Cameron is expected to booted out – possibly hours after the explosive results come in on Friday morning.

It could even mark the end of the EU as other countries may want to jump ship.

Cameron has accused "Brexiteers" of telling porkies and warns leaving will be a leap into the dark that will cost jobs and turn us into a has-been outcast on the edge of EU – and even lead to World War 3.

Other national leaders have said the UK will be a relegated to a pathetically puny power on the national stage.

France’s economic minister Emmanuel Macron has even mockingly claimed the UK, which is the fifth biggest economy in the world, would end up being as important as the tiny Channel Island of Guernsey.

But those wanting to rip-up our membership say Thursday's vote is the last chance to save Britain from being swallowed up by a EU super-state intent on flooding us with migrants.

Euro bosses – mostly not elected by us – are also poised to create a European army stripping our power to defend ourselves from our shores.

Brexiteers say a Euro army means German and French top brass controlling of our squaddies, pilots and sailors – something millions in past wars have died trying to stop happening.

Already Britain is a NATO member and to a degree its troops already take orders from foreigners who are part of the alliance.

But our military is still ours.

It is argued a Euro army would effectively spell the end of the world famous British Army, RAF and Royal Navy because they would be merged into a mega continental military superpower.

This comes amid warnings of a war breaking out with resurgent Russia which is keen to regain the glory it lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

So should Putin’s tanks come rolling over the plains of Poland and Eastern Europe, the UK’s fate would be in the hands of politicians you don’t get a chance to elect or kick out in an election.

Field Marshal Lord Guthrie has dubbed the EU army as "disastrous" and he backs Brexit to block it ever coming about.

"There's a feeling that those backing the European army are doing it for political reasons rather than military ones," he told the Telegraph.

As well as forcing us to surrender control of our army, "Brexiteers" say the EU forces us to cough up £350m each week to prop up other countries' farmers and road building.

They say this could be spent on Brits’ healthcare, schools, economy and defence.

But, worst of all, they claim more poor European nations are set to join up – especially Turkey.

And this will mean more British cash will be demanded to help modernise them.

In return it is said the new members will send millions more migrants to pile in to our already over crowded island.

They say this will make it impossible for young people to buy homes because there is already a housing shortage which is driving prices up.

It will be difficult for their kids to find a local school, many of which are already struggling with a sudden influx of children who can’t speak English.

But the remain camp says this is just scaremongering, that we do not have to join the EU army and that Turkey will not be joining any time soon.

They say leaving will mean we will turned into us into outcasts who would still be bossed around by a much bigger European Union – but have no say on their rules.

European council president Donald Tusk has warned if the UK left the EU would be fatally weakened and David Cameron has warned of Word War 3.

And Cameron, who has staked his political career on staying, has warned there is no turning back once the red button is pressed.

He said: "Once you have jumped out of the aeroplane, you can’t scramble back through the door."

If it does not work out and we rejoin we would have to have the Euro and ditch border controls.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed yesterday that her nationalistic SNP are plotting to call another independence referendum.

This would happen if it turns out most Scots voted to stay in the EU and so end the British union.
