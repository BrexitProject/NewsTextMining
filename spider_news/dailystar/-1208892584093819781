BBC viewers spot 'Hitler' door during EU referendum report

2016-06-24

Britain voted to leave the EU in a monumental decision, but Darren Haines took to Twitter to show the world one of the more quirky things to happen overnight.

He took a screen grab of a reporter giving live updates from a referendum count at the Grangemouth Sports Centre, Falkirk.

In the right-hand corner of the screen, Haines pointed out a set of double doors that looked remarkably like the Nazi leader.

Captioning the picture he wrote: “There is a door in Falkirk that looks like Hitler #bbcreferendum.”

 “The country requires fresh leadership”

And others started to notice the set of fascist doors.

@KennyFarq tweeted: “Has Ken Livingstone been asked for a comment on the #hitlerdoor yet?”

@FACupFactfile added: “Should we be worried that a door in Falkirk looks a bit like Hitler?”

Following the shock result which saw 52% of the electorate vote for the UK to leave the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation.

Cameron – who campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU – said: “The country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.

"I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I don't think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."

The Brexit result could have a seismic impact on the life of many Britons.

Already, the value of the pound has dropped to its lowest value since 1985.

And both Scotland and Northern Ireland are threatening independence from the UK.

But Leave campaigners have hailed the result, with UKIP leader Nigel Farage claiming it was “a victory for real people”.
