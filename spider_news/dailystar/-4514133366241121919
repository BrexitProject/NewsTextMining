Cameron resigns: But was his most embarrassing moment THIS footie gaff?

2016-06-24

David Cameron – who has long proclaimed himself an Aston Villa fan – accidentally said he supported West Ham in a speech last year.

Speaking on racial integration in south London in April 2015, Cameron said the UK is a “shining example of a country where multiple identities work”.

From the platform, the Conservative leader said: “We are a country where you can be Welsh and Hindu and British.”

He continued: “Where you can wear a kilt and a turban. Where you can wear a hijab covered in poppies.”

One of the examples he used was sports related, as he said: “You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.”

In a slip up, he then added: “Of course, I’d rather you supported West Ham.”

Aston Villa and West Ham may play in strips of a similar colour but past that their similarities end.

So how exactly did Cameron momentarily forget which football team he supported?

Blaming his mistake on “brain fade”, Cameron said: “I’m a Villa fan, I don’t know what happened to me. I must have been overcome by something this morning.”

He brushed off the momentary loss of loyalty, saying: “There we are, these things sometimes happen when you’re on the stump.”

Cameron was likely to be even more confused this morning (June 24) when the UK voted to leave the EU in a shock result.

Even Nigel Farage admitted he believed “Remain would edge it” at the start of the night.

However, the Leave campaign stormed to victory in the early hours of this morning by a margin of over one million votes.

Celebrities including footie stars Gary Lineker and Michael Owen have taken to Twitter to share their views on the outcome.

In the wake of the referendum, what will happen now Britain has left the EU?
