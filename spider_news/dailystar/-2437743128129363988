For 15 years the county has received “significant amounts” of EU funding to make up for its weak economy.

The council had been told by the Leave campaign the same amount of funding would still be available before the huge Brexit result was confirmed this morning.

On average Cornwall has received £60million from the EU over the past 10 years.

However despite more than 140,000 people voted to stay in the EU in Cornwall – leavers stormed ahead at a figure of 182,665.

“Now that we know the UK will be leaving the EU we will be taking urgent steps to ensure that the UK Government protects Cornwall’s position in any negotiations”

“Now that we know the UK will be leaving the EU we will be taking urgent steps to ensure that the UK Government protects Cornwall’s position in any negotiations,” said Council leader John Pollard.

“We will be insisting that Cornwall receives investment equal to that provided by the EU programme which has averaged £60M per year over the last ten years.”

Following the shock of Brexit, Scotland and Northern Ireland have threatened to abandon the UK.

And the country’s decision to leave the EU has triggered a massive crash in banking stocks.
