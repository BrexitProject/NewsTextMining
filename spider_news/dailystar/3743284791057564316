A GoFundMe page for the Batley and Spen MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed outside her council surgery in Birstall, West Yorks, was set up and to raise money in memory of Jo.

More than 29,000 contributions had been made by Sunday afternoon, racking up over a million pounds in just three days.

The money will be split between three of Jo's favourite charities – the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets.

“Thank you so much to everyone who has donated, shared and mentioned this fund to friends”

A post on the page, which was started by family and friends of Jo, reads: "We are deeply humbled by the incredible wave of support this page has received.

"Thank you so much to everyone who has donated, shared and mentioned this fund to friends, it is truly astounding to feel this level of solidarity and love for Jo and the values she stood for."

Following Jo Cox's death, the major political parties stated they would not be contesting her seat.

However, a former BNP member has sparked outrage on Twitter after announcing he would be standing.

Jo's family and friends payed tribute to her yesterday.
