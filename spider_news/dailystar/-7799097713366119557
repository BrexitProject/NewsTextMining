All of the Prime Minister's Cabinet ministers who voted Leave put their names to the letter – which states the Prime Minister has a "mandate and a duty" to continue as our leader.

Vote Leave leaders Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are among the senior figures who signed the letter.

The letter states: “We who are supporters of Vote Leave and members of the Conservative Party thank you for giving the British people a choice of their destiny on 23 June.

“We believe that whatever the British people decide you have both a mandate and a duty to continue leading the nation implementing our 2015 manifesto.”

Robert Syms, Tory MP for Poole in Dorset, shared a list of the 84 Brexit MPs who signed the letter and photos of the original documents.

Other Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers to have signed the letter include John Whittingdale, the Culture Secretary, Chris Grayling, the Leader of the Commons and Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland Secretary.

Mr Grayling, MP for Epsom and Ewell in Surrey, said: “It's really important now that the Conservative Party unites and gets on with the job of governing the country."

A record 46.5million people were eligible to take part in today's vote and early reports from across the country suggested a high national turnout.

Minutes after polling stations shut Remain, Nigel Farage claimed Remain had edged the vote.
