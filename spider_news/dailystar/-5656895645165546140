UK FLOOD CHAOS: 'Red alert' as MONTH'S rain falls in just hours on EU vote polling day

2016-06-23

Red "immediate action" flood warnings were issued for parts of south-east London and Essex as parts of the capital were expected to see a month's rain fall in a matter of hours.

Homes have been flooded and people in Romford have had to be rescued by boat by firefighters.

Severe travel disruption is wreaking havoc with flooded train lines, tube stations and submerged roads.

Voter turnout in today's EU Refereundum was predicted to be 80%, but the storms could put that in jeopardy.

The deluge of rain comes despite predictions this weekend would be the start of summer with a heatwave heralding voters to the polls.

Queues are already forming as Brits brave the rain to vote before work.

Mother-of-two Jodie Rose, 37, from Barking in east London, said flooding in her road following the heavy rain would hit voter turnout.

Mrs Rose, who is on maternity leave, said the flood water in her front and back gardens contained sewage and her children were unable to go to school as a result.

The teacher added: "My Nan is 89 years of age and she's already said that she won't be going out to vote."

She said the water was knee-deep around her grandmother's house and that the 89-year-old would not take the "risk" of going out to vote.

The London Fire Brigade said it received hundreds of calls to reports of weather-related incidents – including lightning striking property, flooded homes and businesses and rising waters trapping vehicles.

There were reports of flooded streets as storms swept through, threatening disruption as voters head to polling stations.

Elsewhere, schools are also being closed due to flooding with Hammond School in Cheshire being forced to close its doors.

Train companies are reporting severe disruption on their services – with South West Trains reporting no services between Weybridge and Virginia Water due to a lightning strike.

There are currently no Southern or Gatwick Express trains operating in or out of London Victoria – with reports of flooding in the station and flowing into the tube.

A spokesman for the company said: "The heavy rain we’ve had overnight has flooded the line at Wandsworth Common.

"Network Rail who maintain the track we run our trains on are on site and have assessed the situation and consider it unsafe to allow trains to run over the flooded line."

“There's going to be a bit of hail in there too”

An LFB spokesman said: "Crews are being mobilised to incidents as quickly as possible but the Brigade is appealing to people to only call 999 in an emergency – where there is a risk to life or property.

"Between around 1.30am and 3am our control officers took over 300 calls – around as many as they would receive in an average day."

In just one hour, 20.5mm of rain fell in Bexley, East London – close to half the June average – with some parts expected to see multiple showers bringing a month's rain on Thursday morning.

Firefighters were called to West Norwood station and passengers were evacuated as the line started smoking.

Rail passengers at Clapham Junction said platforms and walkways were a "mass of bodies", bewildered about services which simply disappeared from information boards.

One said: "The trains which did arrive didn't match the ones on the displays so it was difficult to even plan alternative routes.

"It was difficult to even enter the station because an entrance had been closed due to flooding.

"You can't blame the staff, who were doing the best they could with little information, but it's a disgrace to have to put up with these conditions, trains arriving hopelessly late, and then being rammed into stiflingly full carriages - when they eventually arrived - and still paying top dollar."

In Battersea, flood waters rose steadily after heavy rain began to fall after midnight, eventually flowing at knee height into ground floor homes on one street.

There were reports of flooded streets across the capital with roads in Battersea, south-west London, Barking in East London and Lewisham under several inches of water.

Louise March tweeted that there was serious flooding in the Longbridge Road area of Barking and she was concerned over her property insurance.

She wrote: "I saw a car under water people helping to push it out if the water never seen this in the 15 years I've lived here."

Forecaster Luke Miall said: "If you draw a line from The Wash to the Isle of Portland everything east of that is in the firing line.

"A band of showers is coming across the English Channel and moving north-eastwards, which will bring some heavy downpours and localised surface flooding.

"There's going to be a bit of hail in there too – so there's quite a lot going on.

"If you're in the South East, you definitely need your umbrella and possibly a pair of Wellington boots."
