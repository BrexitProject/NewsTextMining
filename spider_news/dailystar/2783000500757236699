Under the hashtag #dogsatpollingstations, photos of the political animals are trending on Twitter.

Perhaps not wanting to miss out on the biggest vote in our generation, pups splish-splashed their way through torrential rain to accompany their owners for the historic vote.

But this is not the first time they have stolen the show.

They were there for the General Election, local elections and now they are back trending on Twitter for the EU.

 “The only good thing about the referendum today is #dogsatpollingstations ”

One Twitter user wrote: "As always #dogsatpollingstations is the best part of voting day."

Dogs Trust tweeted: "It's #EUReferendum day - cue amazing #dogsatpollingstations pics!"

Buzzing about the return of the trend, another tweeted: "The only good thing about the referendum today is #dogsatpollingstations - but that IS pretty good!"
