WATCH: Bloke kicks in his widescreen TV reacting to Nigel Farage's smiling face

2016-06-24

The unnamed man had clearly just woken up to the momentous news that the UK had voted to leave the European Union by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1%.

And in a fit of rage at seeing Ukip leader and Out campaigner Nigel Farage's victory speech this morning, he angrily kicks in his television.

In a clip posted online, the bloke can be seen launching himself feet-first at his widescreen as someone laughs in the background.

But not content he has done enough damage, he then punches it to really prove a point.

The footage was uploaded to social media site Twitter where he wrote a message alongside it saying: "@Nigel_Farage You owe me a new telly." 

Since it was posted, it has garnered a large number of 'Retweets' and comments, with lots of folks calling him an "attention seeker".

One wrote: "Attention seeking much? Someone just happened to be filming when you 'lost your s***'".

Another said: "Calm down dear it's only a referendum. Negative energy is no good to anyone. Lie down in a dark room".

But he's not the only person to take to social media to vent their outrage at the referendum result.

This morning, Twitter was buzzing with Brits expressing their rage at Brexit.
