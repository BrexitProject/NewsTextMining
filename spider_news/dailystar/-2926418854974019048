Thomas Mair – who has been charged following the shooting of Ms Cox – was sent an invoice for £430 worth of books by the National Alliance including information on how to make a homemade pistol.

But Will Williams – leader of the National Alliance – claimed he felt “no guilt” about the attack.

He also said alleged killer Mair was the consequence of her political opinions.

Mrs Cox, Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was attacked in the street outside a meeting with constituents in Birstall.

West Yorkshire Police said Birstall local Mair has been charged with four charges including murder.

National Alliance leader Mr Williams said: “I hear that she loves the idea of bringing a bunch of Muslim refugees from Syria or wherever.

“You can see how people would be opposed to that.

“So she put a target on her back. Mair is the effect.

“The cause is clear to him and he’s reacting. That’s how I look at it.”

National Alliance’s founder William Pierce’s book The Turner Diaries is said to have inspired US terrorist Timothy McVeigh to kill 168 people in 1995.

Mair gave his name as "Death to traitors, freedom for Britain" as he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Saturday.

After the court fell silent, he was asked to repeat his name to which he said: "My name is Death to traitors, freedom to Britain."
