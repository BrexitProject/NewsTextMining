Tiahowler Biltawülf said: "Wouldn't it make more sense to ban the sale of rubbers/erasers in the lead up to future referendums? #PenisBest."

Nick Pettigrew tweeted: "I voted by tattooing my completed polling paper to my face, taking a Polaroid of it and posting that in the ballot box. #penisbest."
