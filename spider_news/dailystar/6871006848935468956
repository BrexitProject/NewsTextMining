The debate was aired tonight ahead of tomorrow's referendum over Britain's continued membership of the EU.

The UKIP leader said he would not participate in the discussion â€“ hours before it was about to start.

Reasons for the MEP's withdrawal were confirmed as being due to "family reasons."

Channel 4's debate was the last televised broadcast before millions of Brits go to the polls tomorrow.

Jeremy Paxman anchored the show.

Farage was scheduled to appear alongside a large number of high profile guests from both the Remain and Leave campaigns.

Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell and the SNP's Alex Salmond are two of the most prominent figures set to feature.

Campbell took to Twitter to say that by not attending the event Farage had "bottled" the TV discussion.

UKIP had offered their MEP Steven Woolfe to take the place of Mr Farage.

However, the offer was declined by Channel 4, a UKIP statement said.
