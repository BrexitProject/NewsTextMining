Leave voters were celebrating this morning as the referendum results rolled in, deciding the UK would leave the EU.

Conservative leader David Cameron stepped down following the Leave vote – leaving speculation as to who will fill his boots.

Although Boris Johnson hasn't yet announced whether he will be throwing his hat into the ring to be Cameron's successor, there are already #BorisforPM hashtags on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The hashtags have a barrage of support for the Uxbridge MP – but some are slightly on the sarcastic side.

I support #BorisforPM @BorisJohnson

Can't wait for everyone to bow down to Boris when he takes over. #WeAreOut #BorisForPM

“It's Friday and the sun is out, stop the moaning #BorisForPM”

Jessica Francis wrote on Facebook: "It's very rare for me to be as passionate about politics as some of you may know but I do think it's finally time for #BORIS to take that PM role."

Ciaran Vere added: "Although I was strongly in favour of remaining, #BorisForPM."

However, not everyone is utilising the hashtag for support.

Twitter user Lucy Brownie wrote: "What the F*** is this."

Parkhead 01 added: "I wouldn't let this man manage a bag of chips."

Katie McHugh wrote on Facebook: #BorisforPM is trending, please let this be a joke hahahaha."

As always with the internet, users got plenty creative with their choice of memes and pictures – with the shot of Boris on a zip-wire proving particularly popular.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is also dealing with calls to resign – and has pulled out of his appearance at Glastonbury Festival.
