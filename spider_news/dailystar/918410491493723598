Dragons' Den entrepreneur Hilary Devey is voting to remain in the EU

So when the Leave campaign tells you that if we pull out of Europe we can have it all – an end to immigration, no harm to the economy or jobs and much more on top – you know they’re taking you for a ride.

It’s obvious Britain can’t be outside the EU and still get all the benefits of it.

If someone came into the Dragons’ Den offering a deal like that, they’d be laughed out of the room.

I know from building my own business and creating jobs that nothing comes easy.I started with nothing and managed to grow my logistics business, Pall-Ex, into an international multi-million-pound company.

“It’s obvious Britain can’t be outside the EU and still get all the benefits of it”

That was thanks in large part to our membership of the EU’s single market.

My business is now a major player across Europe and tens of thousands of British workers rely on it for their livelihood.

To me, the idea of deliberately choosing to do something that would damage your business and cost many of your staff their jobs is barmy.

But that’s what we’d be doing – on a massive scale – if we voted to leave.

Thousands of self-made businesses like mine rely on being able to trade easily with the EU.

Cutting Britain off from its biggest market would hurt our bottom line and mean we couldn’t carry on creating jobs.

Leaving would also mean the UK giving up its say over rules that will continue to affect British businesses.

Worst of all, the Leave campaign have said they want to leave the single market and trade under World Trade Organisation rules.

That would hit UK businesses with trade tariffs, meaning higher prices in the shops.

This is the biggest political decision most of us will make in our lifetimes, impacting our children and grandchildren.

If we get it wrong we can’t change our minds.
