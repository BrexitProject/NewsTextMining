GETTY/TWITTER

The MP for Batley and Spen, West Yorkshire, was shot three times and repeatedly stabbed near the library where she was holding a constituency surgery in Birstall.

All major parties have said they won't contest the by-election out of respect for the MP's family and colleagues in light of the tragedy.

But former British National Party member Jack Buckby has announced he will contest the election for far-right political party Liberty GB.

That Jack Buckby seems the worst of political chancers utter disregard for respectful behaviour and common decency

“I would expect a vote of less than one per cent”

Buckby left the BNP due to concerns the party was becoming racist – but was previously tipped to be a leading figure in the party.

When Buckby announced his plans on Twitter, he was blasted by dozens of angry users.

One wrote: "I would expect a vote of less than one per cent. Here's to you being crushed into the dirt by tolerance, logic and the forces of good."

Jo Coxs funeral hasn't even taken place and @jackbuckby is standing for her seat and is EVERYTHING that is wrong with the world ������

Another added: "Goodness me – what a vile individual Jack Buckby is."

Buckby acts as press officer for the party, which was founded in 2013.

Liberty GB lists its main aims as "halting the Islamisation of Britain" and "promoting British values and assimilation rather than multiculturalism."

It is thought Jo was subjected to a vile three-month hate mail campaign before her death.

Jo's saddening last words were also recently revealed following the tragedy.
