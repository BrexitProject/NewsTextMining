High-Street banking names are being crushed by as much as 30% in some companies.

Banks such as Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC have all taken the brunt of the referendum result.

In a major blow to financial markets, Morgan Stanley has already begun the process of moving 2,000 London based investment banking staff to Dublin or Frankfurt.

The American investment bank is moving jobs in euro clearing as well as other investment banking functions and senior management, the BBC was told.

Confidence in banks recovered somewhat following Bank of England's Mark Carney's announcement that they would prop up the Sterling with an extra £250bn.

But the stock markets have still been at low levels, and banks are suffering.

Lloyds Banking Group fell just shy of 22% when the vote's results came in.

“The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity”

Barclays was down 22% as the economy was smashed by Brexit.

Sterling has also sank by more that 8% against the US dollar while European markets also plunged in response to the referendum.

The FTSE 100 opened down by about 9% but has recovered somewhat and is now down 4.8%.

Elsewhere, gold has had a massive boost today and is trading well above normal levels.

But all European financial markets have suffered massively.

France, Germany and Spain all crashed as the results became clear.

The US Federal Reserve have stepped into the fray and sought to calm global markets by saying it was prepared to provide dollar liquidity.

They said: "The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy."
