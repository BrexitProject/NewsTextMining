“People are angry all over the world. They're angry over borders, they're angry over people coming into the country and taking over”

The Republican presidential candidate arrived in his 'Trump' emblazoned helicopter at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014.

He arrived just an hour after Prime Minister David Cameron announced he will step down in October, following the UK's shocking decision to leave the European Union.

Trump likened the success of the Leave campaign to his rise to promience in the United States.

Trump also issued a statement on his facebook page praising the result.He wrote: "The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples. They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.

"A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense. The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration."

Celebs have been reacting to the shocking result, with Lily Allen taking aim at Jeremy Hunt calling him an "insidious p****".

The world is also begining to feel the impacts, as Spain demands joint ownership of Gibraltar after the Brexit vote and the far-right celebrate across Europe.

Questions remain over what happens now the vote has gone through, and Nigel Farage admitted he could not guarantee EU cash would go the NHS.
