Hot blonde stunt driver takes unsuspecting blind date lads on ride of their lives

2016-06-21

Little did they know the red hot woman they were meeting was a professional stunt driver.

After having a chat in a bar she casually offers them a lift in a brand new Ford Mustang.

A few of the fellas raise their eyebrow and one even arrogantly says: "Do you want me to drive it?"

Another adds: "You want to let me drive it, show you what this thing can do."

Girlishly giggling and pretending to struggle with the gears she then makes a sharp right onto a closed-off driving track.

For the next minute she executes some moves in the car which would make even the Stig look like an amateur.

The men scream, laugh and one even looks on the verge of tears.

After the ride she reveals to them she is actually a stunt driver and rightly so, one or two of the guys don't quite meet her eye when saying their farewells.

The former hosts Top Gear Jeremy Clarkson and James May recently released a video showing they were backing Britain to remain in the EU.
