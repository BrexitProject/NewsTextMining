Brendan revealed the family slept under the stars to remember the Labour MP – just days after she was fatally shot and stabbed.

The touching trip came as well-wishers flocked to a memorial service in her hometown, where she was described as “a 21st century Good Samaritan”.

Jo, 41, was killed as she met constituents in Birstall, West Yorks, on Thursday.

Brendan thanked people for their support and said he and children Lejla, five, and Cuillin, three, had their own unique way of remembering her.

“Last night the kids & I camped in her memory”

He wrote on Twitter: “Jo loved camping. Last night the kids & I camped in her memory and remembered the last time we were all woken by the dawn chorus.”

At a special service at St Peter’s Church in Birstall yesterday, parishioner Leif Wickes said: “Pray for Jo and Brendan’s children still too young to understand the horror of what happened but old enough to suffer from the loss of their mother.

“As they grow up and hear about Jo’s life, may they be inspired to follow her example and serve the world’s underprivileged in their turn.”

Meanwhile, a fundraising website set up to support some of the charities close to the MP has raised £700,000. Thomas Mair, 52, is due to appear at the Old Bailey today charged with Jo’s murder.

Meanwhile, right wing extremists have been slammed for trying to profit from the murder of Jo Cox.

Neo-Nazi group National Action called murder-accused Thomas Mair a “social warrior”.

And US hate group the National Alliance said the Labour MP’s beliefs had left her with a “target on her back”.

Disgusted Brits called for them to be banned from social media.

Author Will Black tweeted: “Thanks to all those who have reported National Action for Jo Cox tweets. #Unite.”
