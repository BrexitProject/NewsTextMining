During an appearance on ITV's Good Morning Britain this morning, the Ukip leader said he couldn't "guarantee" more money would go to the NHS.

This was after a Brexit campaign where Farage repeatedly claimed the UK was giving the EU £350 million each week – cash he said would be better spent elsewhere.

But Twitter users have reacted with outrage after he said it was a mistake to have said that.

In the same interview, he said Brexit was simply the UK becoming "normal".

He also denied he had any ambitions to become Prime Minister, saying his main goal had been taking the UK out of the EU.

But when pressed by Good Morning Britain hosts Susanna Reid and Piwers Morgan, he said it looked as though it would be between Conservative MPs Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox.

At just before 8.30am this morning, David Cameron announced his resignation in a press conference outside 10 Downing Street.

He will stay on in the role until the Conservative Party Conference in October.
