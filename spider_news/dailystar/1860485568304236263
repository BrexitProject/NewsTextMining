Obama assured the United Kingdom and US will manage to maintain their "special relationship" despite Britain's vote to quit the European Union.

In a statement he said: "The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision.

"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership of NATO remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security and economic policy."

Obama also sought to reassure the EU that the US would also reman strong partners with the bloc.

He said America's relationship with the EU "has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond".

The president added: "The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world."

Earlier today, Donald Trump backed the Brexit and said the PM's resignation was 'too bad'.
