Boris Johnson and David Cameron 'gnawing at each others testicles' to blame for Brexit

Controversial Livingstone was suspended from the Labour Party earlier this year for comments about Adolf Hitler.

He told Sky News that the referendum had been blighted by a Tory civil war caused by Cameron and Johnson.

He said: "I have to say it's incredible – there's only about 4% of the coverage that was of Labour people.

"It was like the whole of the media was obsessed by this sort of struggle between Cameron and Johnson as they gnawed away at each other's testicles.

"It was like civil war in the Tory party, not a debate about the economy."

David Cameron resigned as Prime Minister earlier today after the UK voted to leave the European Union.

It is thought Johnson will stand to replace Cameron as Tory party leader.

Labour could also be undergoing a leadership change with critics calling for Jeremy Corbyn to stand down.

But when questioned over Corbyn's role as leader, Livingstone argued that he should not carry any blame for the referendum result.

He said: "Jeremy was telling the truth. If Jeremy had been popping up saying 'this is the most wonderful institution, we shouldn't have any problems with it', everyone would have known he was lying.

"What he said was we should stay in but we should reform it, we need to democratise it, get rid of the horrendous bureaucracy – let euro MPs actually run it, they're directly elected.

"The simple fact is Labour's vote in our traditional strongholds has been declining for decades and it's not because of Jeremy, he's only been leader for the last year.

"It's because the last Labour government didn't rebuild our manufacturing, it didn't build council houses for working class kids to live in.

"It's that sense among the working class that for the last 20 or 30 years the super-rich have cornered all the wealth and ordinary working-class people have seen their quality of life diminished."
