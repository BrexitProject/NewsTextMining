A whopping 50mm of rain will hit parts of the south east in "intense thundery downpours".

It comes as the UK decides whether to stay or leave the EU, amid fears bad weather will hit turnout.

The Met Office has warned flash flooding is expected after the deluge and has issued amber weather warnings for London and the south east.

Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, Kent and Medway are thought to be the worst affected areas tomorrow and traffic chaos for commuters into the capital is feared throughout the day.

Nicola Maxey, forecaster for the Met Office, said: "There is a yellow warning covering the south east.

"This is from 6pm tonight through until Friday morning.

"We could see 30mm of rain in just an hour or 50mm in two or three hours."

And the torrential downpours are feared to continue over the weekend.

"Its not unusual for this weather in the summer, although it should start getting a bit better.
