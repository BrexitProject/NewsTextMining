French President Francois Hollande said the outcome was a "sad choice" which puts the EU in difficulty, adding that he will do everything to secure "deep change" to the Union.

In a joint statement, European Council president Donald Tusk and European Parliament president Martin Schulz, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, holder of the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said: "In a free and democratic process, the British people have expressed their wish to leave the European Union. We regret this decision but respect it.

"We now expect the United Kingdom Government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she had "great regret" at the decision, but added the EU is "strong enough" to "find the right answers" following the vote.

Politicians in Berlin also expressed their disbelief and shock.

Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: "The early morning news from Great Britain is truly sobering.

"It looks like a sad day for Europe and the United Kingdom."

Gabriel Sigmar, the deputy chancellor to Angela Merkel, simply Tweeted "Damn", while the country's Green party chief, Cem Özdemir, said: "A terrible day for Europe.

"Cameron's attempt to win a populist referendum has gone completely belly-up."

Germany's bigest newspaper declared just one word, 'OUT!', on its front page today.

Bild had previously begged the UK to remain within the EU, but now is demanding reforms in the wake of the vote.

It said: "The British referendum must lead to a reform of the European Union!"

It then went on to list things the Union must do to become "adorable" again. These included: cutting back on bureaucracy, EU Commission costs and putting an end to the "circus" of having the EU parliament sit in Strasbourg as well as Brussels.

Today, the German Spiegel magazine, which previously devoted an edition to begging the UK to remain, stated today: "The unimaginable has happened. The Brexit. The British want to leave the EU - against the advice of almost all experts and against economic reason - and against the wishes of other Europeans.

"The result of the referendum is a shock. For Prime Minister David Cameron, for the majority of the political elite, for the economy - and for Europe. For the first time ever, a member country wants to leave the EU. It is a huge vote of no confidence and one that could find imitators. The future of the European Union is at stake.

"Experts fear the country is now headed for a recession. The whole political class in Westminster finds itself standing before enormously difficult times. After this defeat, Cameron will no longer be prime minister."
