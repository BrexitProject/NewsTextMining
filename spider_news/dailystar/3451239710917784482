Brexit’s already made its mark.

The Prime Minister has resigned, Jeremy Corbyn’s under the cosh and Nicola Sturgeon’s threatening another referendum on Scottish independence.

But now the terrorist death cult, otherwise known as Daesh, have vowed to “paralyse” Europe – calling for fresh attacks on Berlin and Brussels.

An encrypted message praised the economic chaos coming from the historic vote and urged followers to strike at the heart of mainland Europe.

And it comes as the Foreign Office advice reads: "There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attacks globally.

"Especially against UK interests and British nationals from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria."

It comes at a time of uncertainty as Brits rush to find out how things will change in a post-Brexit world.

Daily Star Online has already revealed how Brussels boffins are planning a host of secret plans to punish Britain.

And earlier we revealed how the result will impact our passports and how Brits go on holiday.
