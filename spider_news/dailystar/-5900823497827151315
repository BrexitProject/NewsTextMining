Sudanese migrant Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, was granted permission to stay in Britain after being caught walking near the end of the tunnel on August 4 last year.

Ahead of the trial at Canterbury Crown Court he changed his plea to guilty to "obstructing an engine or a carriage using a railway".

A judge sentenced him to nine months in prison – but today he walked free because of time already served.

There are fears that – even before a possible Brexit from the EU – the Channel crossing is becoming as dangerous as the Med for migrants trying to cross.

Twenty migrants were rescued off a boat in the sea by coastguards last month. 

The news comes after truck drivers told of their fears of another summer of migrant mayhem in Calais, France.

Veteran driver Mick Young said the situation is “worse than ever before”.
