PERI PANIC: Nando's fans sent into flap over rumours of UK branches shutting after Brexit

GETTY

Half of the UK voted to leave the EU – but concern was sparked when it was rumoured Nando's could shut in Britain following Brexit.

Dozens of Brits were flummoxed when a blog post went viral, detailing the chicken giants could close because of the Leave vote.

The spoof post, written on themanchesterinsider blog on Tuesday, claimed the chain would be packing up and leaving Britain in the event of Brexit because Nando's is commonly thought to be Portugese – but it's actually South African.

The blog post claims after the news broke one woman offered to swap her baby for a bottle of garlic sauce, fights broke out over bottomless drinks and peri-peri nuts and spicy wings were being sold for "obscene" prices.

@NandosUK are you closing down :( my heart will break

“THEY CAN TAKE MY YOUTH FUTURE BUT I WON'T LET THEM TAKE MY NANDOS”

The blog spread all over social media and garnered some horrified reactions.

One Twitter user wrote: "If only I knew this before my vote... what will I do without Nando's?"

Another added: "THEY CAN TAKE MY YOUTH FUTURE BUT I WON'T LET THEM TAKE MY NANDO'S."

Luckily, the chicken chain was quick to debunk claims they would be going anywhere.

The company tweeted: "Nando's is here to stay. There is no truth in any rumours suggesting otherwise."

Creator of the blog, Chris Hewitt, told Metro.co.uk: "I wanted to do something for the EU and thought about somewhere people would really miss. Nando’s seemed obvious so I went with them."

Although half of the country are happy with the referendum result, the other half think otherwise.

There are already calls for London to become independent – and a worry the referendum could start a "domino effect" among other EU countries.

David Cameron stepped down this morning and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is under fire for how he handled the campaign, even dropping out of his Glastonbury appearance.
