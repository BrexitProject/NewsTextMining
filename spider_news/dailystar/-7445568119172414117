Craig Mackinlay, the Tory MP for South Thanet, was received the message on Facebook.

Kent Police have now announced they’re investigating the message to the Brexit-backing politician.

It follows the murder last week of pro-remain Labour MP Jo Cox last Thursday in a gun and knife attack.

The menacing post was left on Mr Mackinlay’s Facebook page as a reply to a photo where he called for Brexit.

It featured the words “another MP that needs” followed by emoticons of a gun, a knife and a smiling face.

A spokesperson for Kent Police would only confirm that they were investigating the matter.

The politician, a former UKIP member, beat Nigel Farage in the battle for the South Thanet seat.

Quoted last week he said he didn’t want the death of Jo Cox to lead to MPs being less accessible to voters.

He told Kent Online: “We have an open system of access for people and I would not want that to change.

“The last thing I want is for people not to be able to get to see us.”
