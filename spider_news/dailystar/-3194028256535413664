WATCH: Panic as Westfield Stratford shopping centre evacuated

2016-06-24

Shoppers could be seen outside the east London shopping centre in footage posted on Twitter. 

Westfield Stratford City is adjacent to the London Olympic Park, East Village, Stratford Regional and Stratford International stations.

It was not immediately clear what caused the evacuation. 

The news comes as the country comes to terms with the Brexit vote.
