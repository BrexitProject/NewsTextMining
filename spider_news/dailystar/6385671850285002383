Sibi Moore, 25, and Claire Green, 23, staged the protest to "expose the effects" leaving the EU would have on future generations.

The pair wandered around the city centre of Bristol wearing nothing but body paint and tiny knickers.

Sibi was painted as a Union Jack and Claire decorated as an EU flag.

They hope the display will be memorable enough to persuade people to vote to stay.

The two started in Stokes Croft, Bristol, at around 2.30pm, before walking into the popular Harbourside.

They handed out leaflets as they made their way through the city.

Sibi, a healthcare worker, said: "One of the reasons we wanted to do this is because there has been a lot of focus on the various political parties and what they are saying.

"And the fact that David Cameron has come out in support of staying it might put off some people.

"But this is not about political parties and their ideals - this is about the people's vote.

"We wanted it to be slightly playful and get people's attention and we thought this would be a good idea."

She said: "We are trying to make a statement."

Sibi and Claire began their protest in front of a new mural of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump kissing.

There are just four days before Britons will vote in the EU Referendum on June 23.
