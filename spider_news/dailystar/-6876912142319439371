Nigel Farage calls on Cameron to quit IMMEDIATELY after Brexit victory

2016-06-24

The UKIP leader was met with cheers from supporters at the Leave.EU’s party at Millbank Tower in London just minutes ago.

He said “Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.

“This will be a victory for real people. A victory for ordinary people. A victory for decent people.”

Farage described the hard battle the Leave campaign was faced with in the lead up to the vote.

Just moments after the polls had closed Farage had doubts and said it "looks like Remain has won".

“Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day”

The results rolling began to reveal a different outcome.

Farage proclaimed: “We have fought against the multinationals, we fought against the big merchant banks and we fought against big politics.

“We fought against lies, corruption and deceit and today honesty, decency and belief in nation is going to win.”

He also condemned Remain supporters who believe that Jo Cox’s shooter represented Leave.

He added: “We will have done it without a single bullet being fired.”

He also thanked supporters in the Labor, Conservative and UKIP parties as well as those not aligned with any party.

He added: “Who have done it not just for ourselves but for the whole of Europe.

“I hope this victory brings down this failed project and leads us to a Europe of sovereign nation states, trading together, being friends together, co-operating together and let’s get rid of the flag, the anthem, Brussels and all that has gone wrong.

“Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day.”

Asked if David Cameron should resign if the UK has voted for Brexit, Nigel Farage replied: "Immediately.”
