Euro 2016 fans stranded as 300 migrants storm Calais chanting ‘F*** the UK’

2016-06-21

Roads approaching the Eurotunnel Shuttle and ferry terminals were turned into a warzone as French riot police fired tear gas in a desperate attempt to keep the mob at bay.

England football fans were caught in the chaos as gangs of migrants blocked traffic in a bid to break into lorries bound for the UK.

Eyewitnesses report the horde were throwing rocks at cars and chanting: “F*** the UK.”

The incident comes just days before the EU referendum with immigration being a key battle ground ahead of the poll on Thursday.
