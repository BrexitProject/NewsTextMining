The outgoing PM Mr Cameron said he would remain at the helm until the next leader is picked at the Conservative party conference in October.

Now speculation is growing that leading figures from the Leave campaign, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, will go for the job.

Mr Johnson, the former mayor of London, is the bookies favourite for role and is expected to make a speech at 11am this morning.

Justice Secretary Michael Gove could also be a contender, but others have suggested he could end up chancellor under Johnson.

It's also been suggested that Home Secretary Theresa May, a Remain campaigner, will field herself as the only alternative to Boris.

The future for current chancellor George Osborne, a former leadership contender, is now in doubt due to his vocal support for the Remain campaign.

Even Leave campaigners who called for Mr Cameron to stay on after his defeat said this morning that the same was not true of Mr Osborne.
