Betting odds yo-yo as EU referendum result too close to call

2016-06-24

GETTY

Ladbrokes said yesterday was the busiest day of betting in UK political history.

The initial bets were for a Remain win – but as results come in the odds have fluctuated wildly.

Ladbrokes reported 68 per cent of bets were for Leave and 74 per cent of the cash was for Remain at the end of business yesterday.

As the initial voting results rolled in, Ladbrokes had Remain 4/9 – while Leave was at a low of 13/8.

The announcements of a Sunderland vote to leave was a massive blow to the Remain campaign.

It also saw the GBP plummet against the USD.

But by 12.49am it had flipped to Remain with 8/15 and 11/8.

Across most UK bookies Remain has stayed in the lead – but the results are far far less certain.

Currently at 3.12am Ladbrokes and SkyBets have the odds at 5/6 for both Leave and Remain.
