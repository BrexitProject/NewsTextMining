Major high street banks and travel operators have stopped selling Euros.

NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland as well as Thomas Cook have temporarily suspended currency exchanges, while the Post Office travel money website has also crashed.

Customers report arriving at banks only to be told that foreign cash wasn't being given out while those logging onto Bureau de Change websites found they were down.

The value of the pound plummeted after Leave won by a 52-48 margin, a result which has prompted PM David Cameron to quit.

“We’ve seen a high level of demand for travel money and frequent movement of rates”

An RBS spokesman said: “We’ve seen a high level of demand for travel money and frequent movement of rates.

"To better help our customers with their travel money needs we’ve decided to temporarily re-direct all orders to www.travelex.co.uk for up to the minute travel money currency rates."

Thomas Cook announced it has restricted orders to £1,000 worth per customer.

A spokesman said: "We have temporarily suspended our travel money website following unprecedented customer demand for foreign currency overnight and this morning. We apologise to all customers affected.

"Our immediate priority is to ensure that we have enough currency in store to fulfil outstanding orders. We hope to be back up and running as soon as possible."

They later said online orders made yesterday can be picked up in store and that walk-in customers can still buy Euros at today's rate subject to availability.

Meanwhile Matt Rooney from Nottingham tweeted a picture from his holiday in Greece, saying the hotel was no longer accepting pound currency exchanges.

The Post Office website earlier crashed after becoming strained under the high level of traffic.
