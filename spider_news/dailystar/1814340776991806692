Would you do this on the school run? Dad takes driving to the extreme

2016-06-20

Driving around with his son eating cereal in the front passenger seat, the man can be seen hyping himself up as he waits for the beat to drop.

As the tune – Ante Up by M.O.P feat. Busta Rhymes – gets going, the rap-loving dad completely freaks out.

He starts full-on dancing wildly in his seat, yelling and singing along.

Trying to get his unimpressed son to join in, the enthusiastic dad – known as Queenzflip on Twitter – waves an arm in his direction.

With the force of his awesome moves, he knocks the little boy’s cereal straight out of his hands.

The dad doesn’t seem to care his car has been ruined by the milky breakfast, however,as he grabs his son and starts hugging him.

Making his son’s head bop up and down to the beat with such force his hat falls off, the excitable parent is determined to get his little one dancing.

Amazingly still slowly driving, he grabs his now laughing son’s collar and sings along in his face while grooving in his seat.

Social media users have been in stitches after watching the clip, with one saying: "Nobody can keep a straight face witnessing this."

Another commented: "This kid must have enjoyed his childhood – his dad is awesome."

It’s not just dads who a prone to indulging in a spot of cheesy dancing, however.

One lad was forced to pull out some abysmal moves in the middle of the street after he lost a sports bet to his brother.

Meanwhile, Ruth Langsford and Rylan Clark-Neal decided to show off their appalling skills on the dancefloor on TV.
