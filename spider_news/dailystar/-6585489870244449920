'Absolutely bonkers' Twitter has its say as David Cameron quits as PM

SWNS/ TWITTER

The PM told the country it would not be right to be "captain of the ship" while the UK negotiated its EU exit.

He said: "I held nothing back. I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the EU."

Despite his wobbling voice, Twitter expressed little love for the departing leader.

See ya later David Cameron

When you're sad that David Cameron has resigned because he's the lesser of two evils, you know Britain is well and truly going to the dogs

Woo boy PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON HAS STEPPED DOWN. This whole thing is absolutely bonkers

Don't forget it was @David_Cameron hanging on to power via the promise of an EU "re-negotiation" & referendum that got us here - bye bye UK

David Cameron this time knew actually what he was doing!

Time to see if the scaremongering was just that or had some substance to it hey @David_Cameron #EUref

Some on social media were shocked at the PM's announcement.

Although many said they understood he could not continue following Britain's decision to leave the EU.

Stunned & deeply saddened that David has decided to resign.Simply lost for words. Need leadership more now than ever before @David_Cameron
