Lad gets dart stuck in his bum in mate's not very sporting prank

2016-06-24

This poor guy was seriously angry when his opponent decided to aim a pointy dart straight at his behind.

The two men appear to be hanging out in a basement and having a lads' night in. 

Wearing a grey t-shirt and black trousers the middle-aged man can be seen standing with his back to the room.

As the hapless guy pulls darts out of the board, his mate decides to make his move.

Yelling in shock and pain as the dart gets him right on the bottom, the gamer lets off his angst in a stream of colourful swear words.

Turning round in absolute disbelief, he stares at the dart still lodged in his bum as his friend zooms in on the scene.

Although concerned about his injury, the man seems more bothered about the rules of the game as he shouts: “It’s not even your f****** turn!” 

He adds to his mate: “Pull that f****** thing out!”

His friend seemed more exercised by capturing the moment on his smartphone, however, much to the frustration of his pal.

The unfortunate bloke can be heard saying: “Never mind taking a f****** picture, get that f****** thing out of my ass!”

While this man is certainly pretty unlucky, his fate is nothing compared to one pensioner who got a giant sex toy stuck up his bottom.

Meanwhile, this man’s bum also made the news when he was found mooning on Google Maps.
