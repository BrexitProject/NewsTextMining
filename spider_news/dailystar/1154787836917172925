Boris Johnson: Illegal immigrants to get amnesty as a humane option

The former Mayor of London claimed an amnesty was the only humane thing to do if the UK voted to leave the EU on Thursday.

It could help “neutralise” extremists and allow the country to control its borders.

Boris said: “I’m not only pro-immigration, I’m proimmigrants.

“And I am in favour of an amnesty of illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in society.

“I’ll tell you why. Because it is the humane thing to do.

"It is the economically rational thing to do.

“And it means taking back control of a system that is at the moment completely out of control.”

He was speaking alongside Justice Secretary Michael Gove, work and pensions minister Priti Patel and Labour MP Kate Hoey at a Vote Leave rally in central London.

Latest polls suggest there has been a swing in support for the Remain campaign which is 1% ahead of Leave on 44%.

Meanwhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday claimed stretched public serves are due to Tory cuts, not immigration.

He said: “If we leave (the EU) as a country exactly the same arguments are going to be made about housing, about jobs about social security, all those issues are going to be exactly the same on Friday as they are on Thursday.”
