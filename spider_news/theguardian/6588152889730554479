EU referendum: sign up for our experimental mobile alerts

2016-06-22

Many users of the Guardian’s mobile app get notifications, or “push alerts”, on breaking news stories. You might like to know that the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab is currently testing a new style of notification, powered by the Chrome web browser.

If you have an Android phone – Samsung included – we hope you’ll sign up to be part this latest experiment, on Thursday and Friday. We plan to send notifications of the EU referendum results as they come in, as well as a poll on the issues at stake and global reactions to the outcome on Friday.

These are separate from our app notifications, and you don’t have to be an app user to take part in this experiment. Click here to sign up.

The Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab is a small innovation team based in the Guardian’s US newsroom. Learn more here.
