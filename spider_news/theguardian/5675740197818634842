Media Monkey’s Diary: Rupert Murdoch, Brexit and cross-dressing

2016-06-19

• Rupert Murdoch last week passed the 100-day mark for his Twitter holiday, ever since the loved-up honeymooner told his 769,000 followers: “No more tweets for ten days or ever! Feel like the luckiest AND happiest man in world”. But surely he’ll be tempted back next week for the referendum, won’t he, or at least to reappear after it to praise the Sun’s enthusiastic banging of the Brexit drum?

• In a fascinating referendum leader last weekend, the Sunday Times just about toed the pro-Brexit Murdoch press party line – but it did so opaquely and half-heartedly, buried away in an editorial whose main theme (and headline) was about the awfulness of the campaign. Whereas Tony Gallagher’s Sun has enthusiastically campaigned for Brexit and John Witherow’s Times has played its part too, Martin Ivens’s leader was more a sorrowful listing of the problems faced by the Remain camp than a piece putting the case for their opponents: the best it could manage by way of constructive argument was a concluding tortuous assertion that “both the economic and political fallout of Brexit could be better contained than is assumed” – a long way from a call for liberation, or taking control, or (the Spectator’s possibly unwise cover image) the butterfly of Britain escaping the imprisoning box of the EU

• Ben Elton is rarely credited with subtlety, but there was a nice touch in the last episode of Upstart Crow (which was recommissioned last week, confirming his comeback from the comedy wilderness) that only veteran sitcom addicts like Monkey will have picked up on. Like the rest of the series, this crossdressing-themed final instalment was open to the charge of recycling the 1980s Elizabethan series of Blackadder, and particularly its opening episode (the first co-written by Elton) in which Rowan Atkinson’s anti-hero acquires a servant called Bob, who is really a girl called Kate in disguise. However, Elton found a particularly clever way to acknowledge and play with the connection, in a trial overseen by a Judge Robert – who was unmasked at its end by Shakespeare’s friend Kate as a woman in disguise, played by the same actor, Gabrielle Glaister, who was Kate/Bob 30 years ago.

• Harsh words in Television magazine, normally so supportive of telly and telly folk, for the legacy of Monkey’s old friend Richard “Tutti Frutti” Klein (formerly BBC4 controller) as former boss of ITV’s factual division. “ITV factual can only get better,” says one unnamed “industry figure” discussing the prospects of Klein’s replacement Sue Murphy) . “It’s ground zero. It’s a total disaster area. It’s a blasted heath, where nothing is growing”. This may be why, though Klein is seen as a strong contender for the vacant post of BBC2 editor, content supremo Charlotte Moore (who oversees all channels including BBC2) is in the tactful words of Broadcast magazine “yet to be convinced that he would be the right candidate”

• Thursday’s front-page cock-up by the Daily Mail, in which the splash headline (“We’re from Europe - let us in!”) was wrong - Friday’s correction blamed a mistake by a “reputable news agency”, and accepted that the stowaways pictured and supposedly quoted had told police they were from Iraq and Kuwait – was made doubly disastrous by the seniority of the journalists who found themselves somewhat unfortunately in the frame. The most likely explanation is that James Slack and Jason Groves, political editor and deputy political editor respectively, had written a grey round-up of referendum news – that was what the reader turned to on page 2, perhaps blinking at the contrast between migrant misery and the Westminster bubble. - with the material on the stowaway bust used to provide it with a more colourful “nose”. Slack and Groves, giants of the lobby, may well have had nothing to do with reworking and integrating it.

• Oscar Cainer, the Daily Mail’s new astrologer, continues to challenge his editor Paul Dacre with a boldness bordering on insolence. Implicitly accusing him of wilfully choosing “ignorance”, Cainer told Dacre and other Scorpios on Thursday that “there are facts you need to face, issues you must get to grips with, realities you must accept, understand and adjust to”. But what on earth could they be, Oscar? The next day he was less hectoring, but still issuing instructions: the problem this time was Dacre’s mysterious refusal to recognise and use his “talents”: “with the arrival of Venus in Cancer, it’s time to take your attributes out of the cupboard and give them a polish”. Let’s hope the editor-in-chief obeyed and polished them, whatever they are.
