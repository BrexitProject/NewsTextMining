The Labour case for a leave vote in the EU referendum

2016-06-21

Letters




We urge the 

 Privatisation, and the ban on renationalisation, which hands over our public services to private interests

 The ban on state aid and renationalisation as a policy response to the further destruction of British industry and manufacturing

 The EU’s elimination of collective bargaining agreements in the name of competitiveness

 The deregulation of employment contracts and the promotion of zero-hours contracts

 The anti-strike and anti-trade-union policy, which is being used to drive down the cost of labour

 Austerity, which is a foundation stone of the EU, and has led to the slow, creeping destruction of pensions, education, social housing, the NHS and every local public service, as well as strangling local government, further adding to poverty and social inequality

 The policy referred to as “fiscal responsibility”, which aims to co-opt labour organisations into the process of applying austerity policies

 The dangerous TTIP trade deal, which is a Trojan horse for US big business, and if enacted will lead to the destruction of our NHS.

We appeal to all left-leaning and Labour voters to rally together, stand up for our rights and vote leave on 23 June.
