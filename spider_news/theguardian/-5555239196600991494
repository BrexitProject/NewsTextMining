Chancellor warns that failure to clarify EU welfare system will bring about a ‘slow goodbye of the European idea’

The British referendum on membership of the EU could herald the “slow goodbye of the European idea” unless politicians learn their lessons from it, Austria’s new chancellor has said.

“Whatever the outcome of the British referendum, afterwards

Speaking before 

The 50-year-old Kern, formerly the head of Austria’s railway company ÖBB, has taken on the chancellorship of his country at a tumultuous time. His predecessor, Werner Faymann, in power since 2008, resigned after he said he had lost the trust of his party in the face of a far-right surge for the Freedom party (FPÖ).

Last month, Austria nearly voted in the EU’s first rightwing populist president, after the FPÖ candidate, Norbert Hofer, narrowly lost to Green-backed 

“If you look at the confrontation between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, or the Trump phenomenon, then you see: populists thrive on being able to send out a clear message. They tell people where and how decisions are made. Our problem in Europe is that we have a lot of questions that can no longer be answered on a national stage. 

“In Europe, an impression is being created that politics has lost the means to intervene into people’s living conditions. We have to find a clearer message.”

Kern said leftwing parties around Europe needed to reconsider their strategy in dealing with populist parties, with criticism focused on their track record once they had come into power. “In Carinthia, the FPÖ pushed the region to the edge of bankruptcy and left behind a complete mess. We have to call them out on this much more,” he said.

In recent months, 

Last weekend, up to 1,000 Identitarian supporters gathered for a protest in Vienna, chanting: “Homeland, freedom, tradition, end of the line for multiculturalism.” While the group has often been dismissed as media-savvy but politically ineffective, Kern said recent events should prompt a rethink about the group’s legality.

The Identitarian movement, he said, was “a movement that is generally considered to be rightwing extremist; if you saw what they did in Vienna last week, it reminds you of the marches in the 1930s, with flags and all the trimmings. We have to think about whether we are too tolerant.”

Asked whether the group should be banned, Kern said: “Until last week, I would have denied that but, in the meantime, I have started to have my doubts. Three weeks ago, I also said that we have managed to accept 90,000 refugees without seeing any arson attacks on asylum seekers’ homes. In the meantime, we’ve had an instance like that. Things can change quickly.”

Kern’s predecessor went from being one of the key supporters of Angela Merkel’s open-border strategy at the height of the refugee crisis to one of its most active critics, and the Austrian foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, was one of the key players behind the closure of the Balkan route in March.

Asked if he felt the German chancellor had made a mistake when she suspended the Dublin agreement for Syrian refugees last summer, Kern said: “We were all surprised by the scale of migration movements. You can only judge such decisions in the context of the time. 

“Back then, Angela Merkel’s actions were justified. If you look now at what lengths the German chancellor is going to with Turkey, then it is clear that she wants a change of direction. I don’t want to imagine what happens when the Turkey deal fails.”
