The killing of a Member of Parliament on the streets of her constituency has shocked British politics. 

Labour MP Jo Cox was elected in 2015 with a long history of campaigning on behalf of refugees and marginalised people. She leaves behind a husband and two young children.

Her violent death brought Britain’s fevered referendum to a halt and has led to an examination of the context of an increasingly bitter campaign, full of anti-establishment anger.
