Boris Johnson will face off against the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, in the BBC’s final televised debate of the referendum campaign, the broadcaster has announced.

Davidson will be joined on the main stage at Wembley Arena in London on Tuesday by Johnson’s successor as mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, for the remain side.

Johnson will again team up with the energy minister, Andrea Leadsom, and the Labour MP Gisela Stuart in the same lineup that represented the leave camp in the ITV televised debate earlier this month.

A further 10 guests, five from each side, will provide additional opinion and commentary from a second stage. Leave will be represented by the employment minister, Priti Patel, the Ukip MEP Diane James, Harsimrat Kaur from Women for Britain, the Wetherspoon founder and chairman, Tim Martin, and the journalist and author Tony Parsons.

On the remain side there will be the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the SNP MSP Humza Yousaf and the former Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King.
