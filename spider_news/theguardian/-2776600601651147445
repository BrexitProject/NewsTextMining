How will we reunite our divided nation, whichever side wins the EU referendum?

The EU referendum campaign has taken a very nasty turn, with widespread intimidation. Last week, the rear window of my car was smashed in, for no other reason than it happened to bear a “remain” sticker. The referendum, which was intended to settle the issue once and for all, has polarised the nation in a way it has not been since the issue of Irish home rule in the late 19th century.

There is clearly no national consensus, and the nation is divided right down the middle. Whichever side wins, half the nation will be dragged in a direction in which it does not want to go, yet no one appears to have given any thought to what needs to be done to reunite the nation. The situation is politically toxic, and, if not addressed seriously, will lead to dislocation not seen in this country since the Glorious Revolution of 1688.
