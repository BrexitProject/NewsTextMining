A place for Jo Cox in Parliament Square

2016-06-20

Jo Cox MP, passionate for peace and justice, embodied all-embracing love. She is already recognised as a model of compassionate humanity for the 21st century. We propose that she should be commemorated by a statue to be placed alongside the statesmen of yesteryear in Parliament Square in London. That is clearly subject to approval by Jo’s family.Dr Barbara Einhorn Emeritus professor of gender studies, University of Sussex, Canon Dr Paul Oestreicher Former chair, Amnesty International UK

• David Cameron (I need to make better EU case, says Cameron, 20 June) should heed (and slightly adapt) the wise words of lyricist Johnny Mercer when in 1944 he wrote: “You’ve got to accentuate the positive / Eliminate the negative / Latch on to the affirmative / And don’t mess with Govey (or Johnson?) in between.” Maybe he should sing it – he must know the Harold Arlen tune – on his next soap-box appearance. Could work wonders. Paul Zerdin(Winner of season 10, NBC’s America’s Got Talent), Las Vegas, Nevada, USA
