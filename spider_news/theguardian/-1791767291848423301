We Nobel prize-winning economists believe the UK is better off in the EU

2016-06-19

Economic issues are central to the UK referendum debate. We believe that the UK would be better off economically inside the EU. British firms and workers need full access to the single market. In addition, Brexit would create major uncertainty about Britain’s alternative future trading arrangements, both with the rest of Europe and with important markets like the USA, Canada and China. And these effects, though one-off, would persist for many years. Thus the economic arguments are clearly in favour of remaining in the EU.George AkerlofKenneth ArrowAngus DeatonPeter DiamondJames HeckmanEric MaskinJames MirrleesChristopher PissaridesRobert SolowJean TiroleWinners of the Nobel prize in economics
