Reading about the EU and Belfast 

 I am as Eurosceptic as the next, but cannot I understand why little mention has been made of the “referendum lock” act of 2011 which automatically triggers a referendum should a treaty change be requested by the EU. It seems obvious that such a request will be made sooner rather than later in the eurozone in order to form a fiscal union to save the euro. When this happens, the UK could obtain all the concessions that Mr Cameron failed to get. I am voting Remain in anticipation of the next referendum.

 You really couldn’t make it up:

 By now Tim Peake is probably wishing he had stayed in space for another few days and avoided all the garbage the politicians are throwing at us.
