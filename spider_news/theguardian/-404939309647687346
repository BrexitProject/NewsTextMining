Are you doing anything in preparation for the EU referendum result?

Earlier this week it was reported that Brits are panic-buying their travel money ahead of the EU referendum.

It’s been claimed that a Brexit vote could lead to falls in the pound leading many holiday makers to get foreign currency now. The Post Office said that its currency sales had surged by 74% year-on-year since the weekend with hundreds queuing up to exchange their pounds.

Are you doing anything today because you’re fearful about the outcome of the referendum? Have you decided to buy up foreign currency? Book a holiday? Scramble to complete a property deal? Maybe you’re even going a step further and marrying a Brit or applying for jobs overseas? We are also keen to hear from business owners who may have been planning for months in anticipation of the result? Share your story with us below.
