E4 reality show stars film skit urging young people to vote in EU referendum




 is doing its bit to encourage young people to vote in Thursday’s EU referendum with a comedy skit featuring the cast of E4’s Made in Chelsea.

Binky, Jamie, Mark-Francis and Toff get round the dining room table to discuss the finer points of in or out – such as, we will still be able to compete in Eurovision?

It’s everything that is best – or worst – about TV today, but may remind a few younger people to cast their vote. The BBC has no plans for a Last of the Summer Wine special to do the same among older people. 

E4 has a habit of doing this sort of thing – last year it 

Channel 4’s chief marketing and communications officer Dan Brooke said: “In 2015 we turned off E4 on election day and this year the cast of E4’s top show are adding to the referendum debate in a quintessentially Made in Chelsea way – but above all reminding viewers to make their vote count on 23 June.”

The promo will play on E4 and in various guises across the broadcaster’s social media outlets. Made in Chelsea. Stay in Europe?
