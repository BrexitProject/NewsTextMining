What does the EU referendum mean for Northern Ireland and Ireland?

2016-06-16

More than half a million Irish people in the UK, and the whole adult population of Northern Ireland, can vote on 23 June. If you live in Ireland, north or south, share your thoughts on the EU referendum, and how the outcome will impact your life.

Over the past half century the British-Irish relationship has evolved into a much more mutually respectful relationship after centuries of hurt. Despite still being haunted by the Troubles, progress has been embodied in a lack of recrimination in this year’s Easter Rising centenary and by next month’s Somme centenary.

Ireland and the UK’s membership in the EU has been a large financial support to the peace process. The EU has provided more than £2bn to Northern Ireland in the six years to 2020.

If Brexit happens, Sinn Féin has said a new vote in Northern Ireland on unification would be necessary. If such a vote went the republicans’ way it could destabilise the current mood.

If the UK votes to leave the EU, the two parts of Ireland would be on different sides of the EU land border potentially putting border controls and customs checks in place putting a strain on trade and the movement of people.

If you live in Northern Ireland, or Ireland, we’d like you to share your thoughts on the EU referendum, and how the outcome might affect your life.
