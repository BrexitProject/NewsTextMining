The Labour case for a leave vote in the EU referendum

2016-06-21

We urge the Labour movement to come together, stand up for the rights and future of UK workers, and vote leave in the EU referendum on 23 June. A vote to leave is a chance to stop the following regressive policies:

• Privatisation, and the ban on renationalisation, which hands over our public services to private interests

• The ban on state aid and renationalisation as a policy response to the further destruction of British industry and manufacturing

• The EU’s elimination of collective bargaining agreements in the name of competitiveness

• The deregulation of employment contracts and the promotion of zero-hours contracts

• The anti-strike and anti-trade-union policy, which is being used to drive down the cost of labour

• Austerity, which is a foundation stone of the EU, and has led to the slow, creeping destruction of pensions, education, social housing, the NHS and every local public service, as well as strangling local government, further adding to poverty and social inequality

• The policy referred to as “fiscal responsibility”, which aims to co-opt labour organisations into the process of applying austerity policies

• The dangerous TTIP trade deal, which is a Trojan horse for US big business, and if enacted will lead to the destruction of our NHS.

We appeal to all left-leaning and Labour voters to rally together, stand up for our rights and vote leave on 23 June.Kelvin Hopkins MP Labour, Luton NorthKate Hoey MP Labour, VauxhallGraham Stringer MP Labour, Blackley and BroughtonRoger Godsiff MP Labour, Birmingham Hall GreenElaine Smith MSP Labour, Central ScotlandRonnie Draper General secretary, BFAWUTosh McDonald National president, ASLEFArthur Scargill Former president, NUMSteve Hedley Assistant general secretary, RMTGawain Little National executive, NUTAlan Gibson National executive, NUJMandy Brown National executive, UCUKaren Reissmann National executive, UnisonPaul Williams National executive, PCSJohn Sweeney UcattLen Hockey UniteTam Dewar CWUVal Guiraud NASUWTDoug Nicolls Chair, Trade Unions Against the EUBrendan Chilton General secretary, Labour Leave
