The referendum decision is nigh – but what of the losers?

2016-06-21

The concluding sentences of your editorial (21 June) are bizarre. “Vote for a unified country ... vote against a divided nation”. Supposing remain wins – are Brexit supporters to be liquidated? Whichever way it goes, it is likely that nearly half the voters will have voted for the rejected option. The nation is already divided, and the “losers” will hardly relinquish their beliefs on the spot. If the vote is very close, the fight will continue.Josh SchwiesoSpaxton, Somerset

• I brokered an agreement with my mother– in her 90s and unlikely to have many years to live with the result of Thursday’s vote – to use her vote to reflect the view of my daughter, aged 16 and therefore with no vote but a reasonable expectation of many years living with the result.Maurice HersonOxford

• Labour leave supporters are no doubt as sincerely committed to social justice and democracy as those in the remain camp. But whatever the formal purpose of the referendum or the words on the ballot paper, isn’t Baroness Warsi right that the vote is now about our basic values? And if so, shouldn’t Labour parliamentarians still in the leave camp follow her wise example?Brendan MartinLondon

• While it is encouraging to see prominent economists supporting remain (We Nobel prize-winning economists believe the UK is better off in the EU, 20 June), they are preaching to the converted. Are such letters ever submitted to papers supporting leave, and do they ever appear? There they might change some minds.Martin WrightSale, Greater Manchester

• I note that in the Sport section (21 June) you give the location of Euro 2016’s match seven in the round of 16 as the Stade de Lyon on Monday 27 June. It is in fact to be held at the Stade de France. Surely we have had enough misinformation about Europe.Des WatersLondon
