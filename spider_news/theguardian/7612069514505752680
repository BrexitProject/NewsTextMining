Northern Ireland peace process and European funding

2016-06-22

Reading about the EU and Belfast (Letters, 20 June) reminds me of one part of the EU story that I’ve not seen mentioned so far. When working in Derry a few years ago, I took the opportunity to ask what people felt had had the greatest effect in bringing peace. The overwhelming consensus was that a key element was the influx of money financing regeneration out of EU funds, which helped convince people on both sides that peace was worth working for. Something which would have been politically impossible if the money had come direct from Westminster.Charles HarrisLondon

• I am as Eurosceptic as the next, but cannot I understand why little mention has been made of the “referendum lock” act of 2011 which automatically triggers a referendum should a treaty change be requested by the EU. It seems obvious that such a request will be made sooner rather than later in the eurozone in order to form a fiscal union to save the euro. When this happens, the UK could obtain all the concessions that Mr Cameron failed to get. I am voting Remain in anticipation of the next referendum.Francis VinesCheltenham, Gloucestershire

• You really couldn’t make it up: Andrew Phillips writes (Letters, 22 June)to complain about the “democratic deficit” of the EU … from the House of Lords!Dr Richard CarterLondon

• Frederika Roberts (Letters, 20 June) found the words to express my sense of dismay and helplessness better than I ever could. My British husband of 45 years is feeling equally bereft at the thought of a Brexit outcome to the referendum; he has just announced that at the grand old age of 76 he will apply to become French in order to have dual nationality like our daughters. Just one more example of an older citizen not intending to vote leave!Maidi BrownShenfield, Essex

• By now Tim Peake is probably wishing he had stayed in space for another few days and avoided all the garbage the politicians are throwing at us.Keith WightmanBarbon, Cumbria
