Trump camp supports Britain leaving EU, citing America's ‘own little Brexit’

2016-06-21

Donald Trump’s campaign has renewed his support for the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, stating “America is here because of its own little Brexit”.

Spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, a longtime Trump aide, did not specify whether she was referring to the American revolution or whether she saw a modern parallel between the US political situation and the European Union, where the issue of immigration has become a political lightning rod.

In an interview with Sky News,Pierson noted that the presumptive Republican nominee is “very much in favor of countries doing what is best for them” and thought that in the current global situation, “countries do need to re-evaluate their own standings and what is best for them”.

The Trump campaign aide’s statement came two days before the candidate is scheduled to fly to Scotland for the ceremonial reopening of his golf course at Turnberry. The trip coincides with the announcement of the result in the Brexit referendum where British voters will decide whether the UK should exit or remain a member of the European Union.

Trump is expected to comment on the issue in a press conference in Scotland.

He is one of the few international figures to come out in support of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. In a May interview with Fox News, Trump explicitly linked continued British membership to concerns about “migration”. He said: “I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe. A lot of that was pushed by the EU.” Trump added: “I would say that they’re better off without it, personally, but I’m not making that as a recommendation. Just my feeling.”

In contrast, there is bipartisan support from most American politicians for continued British membership of the European Union, including from both President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
