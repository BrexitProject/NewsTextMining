Vote Leave gets big donation from former BNP member on leaked list

2016-06-21

One of the biggest single donors of Vote Leave has been identified as a former British National party member on a leaked list, it has emerged.

Gladys Bramall, 87, from the West Midlands, has given the campaign £600,000, according to Electoral Commission records released on Tuesday.

A leaked list of BNP members from 2008 includes her name. According to Buzzfeed News, she said she must have been signed up by her late husband, Leonard Bramall, a BNP supporter.

The link could be embarrassing for the Vote Leave campaign, which has sought to distance itself from accusations of racism among its more extreme elements.

Brexit campaigners have raised more funds than their remain rivals, according to the last set of published figures before Thursday’s vote in the EU referendum.

Pro-leave campaigns have received around £16m and groups on the remain side around £12m, the elections watchdog said today.

On Monday, the Guardian disclosed that a Vote Leave board member resigned after promoting anti-Muslim material on social media. Arabella Arkwright, a businesswoman, shared an image of a white girl in the middle of a group of people wearing burqas saying: “Britain 2050: why didn’t you stop them Grandad?” She denied any wrongdoing.

Vote Leave also received a £1m donation from Conservative donor Diana Van Nievelt Price. She once paid £440,000 for a portrait of Baroness Thatcher at a Tory fundraising ball.

Other notable gifts in the most recent period included two donations of £100,000 from construction vehicle company JCB, and £25,000 from socialite Annabel Goldsmith, the mother of the failed London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith.

The campaign also received £100,000 from the economist Roger Bootle and £100,000 from former Tory treasurer Lord Farmer.

In previous submissions, a majority of Vote Leave donations have come from Tory donors. They include International Motors, run by Lord Emiston, which has given more than £850,000, and Michael Freeman, the property developer, who has given £348,000. Jeremy Hosking, the private equity and Crystal Palace FC investor, has given more than £1m to Vote Leave and £480,000 to the Brexit Express, a campaign to distribute posters across London and other major cities.

Each of the officially designated lead campaigns – Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe – has been able to spend up to £7m in the 10 weeks leading up to the referendum, while the smaller registered groups can spend up to £700,000. The two main campaigns have received £600,000 in public grants.

In its last report on donations before the vote on 23 June, the Electoral Commission recorded £2,708,994 in gifts to Vote Leave from 13 May to 9 June, out of a total £3,596,994 given to pro-Brexit groups.

This compared with just £1,886,055 for the Stronger In campaign, which took the bulk of the £2,887,917 in donations to the remain side.

A final report on donations received in the last weeks before the poll will be released after votes are counted.

Stronger In also received a £1m gift, from travel company Trailfinders. Its other big donors in the period included financier Mark Coombs, who gave £250,000; entrepreneur Michael Lynch, who gave £100,000; and hedge fund investor Ian Wace, who handed over £100,000.

The Labour peer Lord Sainsbury, who was once the party’s biggest funder, has given £3.48m to pro-remain groups including Scientists for EU and the European Movement of the UK.

Other prominent remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding, who gave £750,000 in March; businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman, who gave £500,000; and an unincorporated association, Tower Limited Partnership, which gave £500,000.

The government has been criticised by leave campaigners for spending more than £9m on sending leaflets backing EU membership to all UK households before the spending limits came into force.

A Vote Leave spokesman did not respond to a request for a comment.
