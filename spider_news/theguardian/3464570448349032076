In, Out – then shake it all about for Sun readers over the border

2016-06-19

The Times, with two-thirds of its readership remainers, votes In. The Sun, with two-thirds leavers, votes Out. But there’s a difference between reader awareness and truckling calculation. Even if you knew about the Bun’s bounces in electoral advice – vote Tory down south, SNP in Scotland – you reckoned that something as portentous as last week’s “BeLEAVE in Britain” front page would be a message for the whole UK. But no: it got lost as it crossed Hadrian’s Wall then sank in the Irish Sea. Believe in telling your faithful in particular places what polls tell you they want to hear? Of course. But don’t believe in some loftier purpose either.
