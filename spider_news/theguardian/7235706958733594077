The City remains confident that the UK is on course to remain a member of the EU despite a late flurry of sell orders after a new opinion poll boosted 

After a day in which shares and the pound had both risen amid growing confidence that David Cameron’s gamble to call the vote would pay off, there was a last-minute wobble following the publication of an Opinium survey that gave the leave campaign a marginal lead.

Despite the late sell-off, the FTSE has regained the losses it sustained last week when the City started to take fright that a Brexit was on the cards. City dealers expect the FTSE to plunge if both they and the bookmakers are wrong about their assumption that the referendum will back staying in the EU.

According to predictions by a UBS strategist, Yianos Kontopoulos, £350bn could be wiped off the FTSE 100. He 

“Following the risk-rally of the last few days, we believe there is significant room for downside in the event of a leave vote,” Kontopoulos said.

Brokers said there had been a correlation between the FTSE and the polls in recent days. 

Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at brokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “In the long run the jury is out on what Brexit means for the stock market, given the number of variables involved.

Warning that the pound could fall whatever the outcome of the referendum, Edwards said: “There is an argument that a Brexit might look similar to the aftermath of sterling’s ignominious exit from the ERM. After [that] much feared event the UK economy actually recovered strongly and unemployment fell sharply. 

“In a current environment, where central banks and governments have failed to generate a strong enough economic recovery to normalise interest rates amid persistent deflationary pressures, one would have thought a substantial decline in one’s currency would be welcomed – for that is one way to inject a modicum of inflation back into the economic system.”

Britain ran a 

“The UK economy is a mess and that has nothing to do with Brexit, it has everything to do with economic mismanagement,” Edwards said. “I think sterling will end up falling substantially whether the UK stays or leaves the EU. It is just a matter of timing.”
