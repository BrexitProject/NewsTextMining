EU referendum debate dominated by 'white men in suits'

2016-06-22

The debate around the EU referendum has been “monopolised by a mono-chatter of white men in suits”, according to almost 140 black and minority ethnic women who have written to the Guardian to call on people to vote remain in a “gesture of hope”.

The group, which includes the commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and TV presenter June Sarpong, say the debate has “brought rage, despair, hope, confusion and fear”.

They argue that the EU is not perfect but has set in place rights for workers, including the poorest in society, and funded efforts against racism and xenophobia.

“As women of colour, we put our names to this letter for many reasons. Like millions of ordinary Brits, we care about our country and its peoples. We care about our children’s future. We honour our country’s past …

“Equally important, we want our voices heard. Too much of this debate has been monopolised by a mono-chatter of white men in suits. Understandable at one level, unacceptable at another.”

They say that minority voters make up 16% of our population, arguing there is no excuse for the lack of plurality of voices in the media.

The women say a vote to remain would be “an action to look outwards, not inwards; for the belief that fear will not win and hatred is not perpetrated in our name”.
