The humiliation of Greece is an act of economic war by the EU

2016-06-19

In praise of the EU (The aftershocks of a leave vote will rebound on Britain, 18 June), Natalie Nougayrède tells us that the EU “as an entity” has never invaded anyone. But what would you call the EU’s treatment of Greece? When a country is humiliated, its people impoverished and its public assets sold, would that be seen as an act of a friendly and decent institution or an act of war? For, while guns may not have been used, the outcome is the same. Does the EU’s disregard of the wishes of the Greek people, expressed in two general elections and reinforced by a referendum, reflect the EU’s defence of democracy and cooperative nature, or naked and brutal control?Fawzi IbrahimTrade Unionists Against the EU
