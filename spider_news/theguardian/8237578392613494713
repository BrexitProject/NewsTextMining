Please think of the vote-less young – remain for our sakes

Every day as I walk back from school, I pass a large red Vote Leave placard. On the TV and radio news, in the papers, the discussion of Europe continues. Yet it is not the never-ending coverage that is bothering me – it is that, at 16, I am not able to participate in the referendum. I am infuriated that I do not have a say in a matter that is going to directly affect me as an adult. The futures of young people are being decided by those older than us: some who possibly care very little and may not have to live with the outcome as long as we will. What shocks me is the number of adults who do not vote. For every person who does not put their paper in the ballot box, there are many under-18s who want to have their say, their voices heard. Please vote remain.

 I am hoping that the result of Thursday’s vote has been predicted by the children at the primary school where I work. Two weeks ago I led an EU referendum assembly for years 4, 5 and 6. After hearing the respective cases for leaving and remaining, question and debate, the children returned to their classes to vote on ballot papers. The next day there was a big cheer as the results were announced; 131 remain, 45 leave. 100% turnout. (No spoilt ballots.)
