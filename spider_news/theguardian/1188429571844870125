Did you vote leave in the UK's EU referendum? Tell us why

2016-06-24

Britain has voted to leave the European Union in a historic vote which saw more than 30 million people turn out to vote - the highest turnout at a UK-wide vote since 1992.

Despite last minute opinion polling showing a swing to remain just 16,141,241 people to remain a member of the EU, compared to 17,410,742 who voted to leave.

In London some areas showed large majorities for remain: 75% in Camden; 78% in Hackney; 66% in Kensington and Chelsea. But remain was an exception across many parts of the country. Leave’s overall lead owed much to the coast, and the east of England.
