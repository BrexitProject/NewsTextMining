MPs to wear flowers and colourful scarves in Commons in tribute to Jo Cox

2016-6-20

POLITICIANS from all sides will wear flowers and scarves in the Commons today as they return to Parliament to pay tribute to fallen Labour MP Jo Cox.

Whips sent round the suggestion yesterday as Labour and Conservative MPs prepared to unite for an emotional day in Westminster.

Male MPs are set to wear the white rose of Yorkshire in Jo’s honour - while women MPs are being encouraged to wear colourful scarves.

Justice Minister Dominic Raab and Green MP Caroline Lucas both donned a white rose on the BBC’s Sunday Politics show yesterday.

One MP told the Sun: “It’s a brilliant idea that we’re very keen to b`ack as well to show her loss has been felt across all parties.”

Jeremy Corbyn on Friday revealed Parliament would be recalled to let MPs pay tribute to Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed in the town of Birstall, Leeds on Thursday.

Around 90 minutes of tributes will begin at 2.30pm before MPs head to a special service at the church of St Margaret, on the grounds of Westminster Abbey.

MPs had discussed the idea of mixed seating in the Commons – stripping away traditional party allegiance – but it is understood many Labour MPs wanted to sit together.

Labour’s Jess Phillips yesterday tweeted: “In understand the gesture of politicians all sitting together I don’t oppose it, but I know I will want to sit with my friends for support.”

Fellow backbencher Diana Johnson added: “I think you’re right and we will sit with the people we know best at this very sad time.

“But I like the signalling of unity.”
