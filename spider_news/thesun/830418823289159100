James Bond actor Daniel Craig backs Remain as host of celebs pledge allegiance to Brexit

2016-6-22

‘RETIRING’ James Bond actor Daniel Craig has thrown his weight behind the Remain camp as celebs battle it out in the EU referendum.

Throughout the campaign both sides have been bolstered by celebrity endorsements, with Michael Caine, John Cleese and Sir Ian Botham leading the charge to the EU exit door.

Trying to hold back the tide, David Beckham, Idris Elba and Sir Elton John have all come out for Remain in recent weeks.

Last night Craig, who is rumoured to have turned down an offer to do a fifth film, joined their ranks as a picture emerged of him sporting a pro-EU t-shirt with the message: “No man is an island. No country by itself.”

Minutes after the picture was published, David Cameron tweeted it along with the words: “It’s great to see Daniel Craig is planning to Vote Remain on Thursday.”


Sir Michael Caine

The veteran Italian job actor was one of the first out the blocks to back Leave, declaring: "You've now got in Europe a sort of government-by-proxy of everybody who has now got carried away. Unless there is some extremely significant change, we should get out."

Sir Ian Botham

One of the more outspoken Leave celebs, Beefy has branded the EU "corrupt" and a "racket.

Appearing alongside Boris Johnson last month, the former England cricket captain said power had been "eroded by Brussels", adding: "I think hang on, enough's enough."

John Cleese

The Monty Python star has rubbished claims there could be notable reforms of the EU.

The Fawlty Towers comedian took to Twitter, saying: “If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU, I'd vote to stay in. But there isn't. Sad.”

In an outspoken blast, he said the EU needed to "give up the Euro, introduce accountability and hang Jean-Claude Juncker (President of the EU Commission)."

Elizabeth Hurley

The 50-year-old actress wants to quite the EU so she can get her hands on 60 watt lightbulbs and high-powered hairdryers.

She quipped: “If it means we can go back to using decent lightbulbs (60-watt, peach-coloured, both bayonet and screw-in) and choose high-powered hairdryers and vacuum cleaners if we so wish, I’m joining Brexit for sure.”

Vote tomorrow-whatever your persuasion. I'm for #Brexit & promise to neither gloat nor whinge. But VOTE! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 pic.twitter.com/6Faq4HHMJE

David Beckham

Yesterday  David Beckham urged voters to choose Remain "for our children and their children" in a tweet shared by wife Victoria saying she was "so proud of David".

But are the power couple split on the matter?

In 1996 Posh said :“The Euro-bureaucrats are destroying every bit of national identity and individuality. Let me give you an example — those new passports are revolting, an insult to our kingdom, our independence. We must keep our national individuality.

“Do you not care if some bloke in Germany is making decisions for us?”

She was not amused, saying her comments were "being misused".

Bob Geldof 

Bob Geldof was blasted by his own side for sticking two fingers up to British fishermen as flotillas of boats backing both Leave and Remain clashed on the Thames.

Pro-EU activist Bethany Pickering disembarked Geldof’s pro-EU boat in disgust, saying “we didn’t expect it would be a billionaire being condescending to fishermen.”

Richard Branson

The billionaire founder of the Virgin empire has launched a nationwide campaign to urge people to back Remain saying that leaving the EU would be too risky for even him "not as an investor, not as a father and not as a grandfather. I am deeply concerned about the impact of leaving.

But the Sir Richard won't be voting on Thursday as he does not have the right as he lives in British Virgin Islands tax haven.

Sir Elton John

Sir Elton John kept his message short and to the point, by saying simply: "Build bridges not walls."

He added: "I'm voting to remain. #StrongerInEurope."
