Shell-shocked German Chancellor calls for calm as far-right demands break up of EU

2016-6-24

A shell-shocked Angela Merkel appealed for calm after the Brexit storm as right-wing parties sought to break up the EU even further.

The German chancellor expressed 'great regret' at Britain's Out vote but insisted Europe was 'strong enough' to hold firm.

Her comments came after prominent figures on the Continent called for their countries to follow the UK's lead and hold their own referendums.

Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said the EU had contributed to peace on the continent, but that stability could not be taken for granted in a "world of turmoil".

She said: "We have to recognise the decision of the majority of the British people with deep regret today.

"There is no point beating about the bush: Today is a watershed for Europe, it is a watershed for the European unification process.

"The idea of European unification was the idea of peace after centuries of horrendous bloodshed.

"The founding fathers found a way to come together and it was manifested in the Treaty of Rome almost 60 years ago.

"For the future, we should not take this for granted."

French President Francois Hollande described it as a 'grave test' for the bloc which he 'regretted profoundly'.

The two leaders and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi are due to hold damage limitation talks in Berlin on Monday.

Hours earlier, Dutch anti-immigration leader Geert Wilders was one of the first to call for his country to launch a ‘Nexit’ bid, sparking a domino effect across Europe.

He said: "We want be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders, and our own immigration policy."

France's far-right National Front party leader Marine Le Pen hailed the result as a 'victory for freedom' and called for the country's own referendum.

She told RTL radio: “Like a lot of French people, I’m very happy that the British people held on and made the right choice. What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible.”

He posted a picture on her Twitter page proudly holding the Union flag.

Her deputy, Florian Philippot, added: "The liberty of peoples always wins in the end! Bravo to the United Kingdom. Our turn now."

Their comments were echoed by Le Pen's niece and fellow National Front member, Marion Le Pen, who insisted the French 'should have the right to choose'.

Paula Bieber, from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party, congratulated Britain and declared: 'Swexit will follow'.

Elsewhere reaction has proven mixed.

France foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described it as an “emergency”.

He tweeted: “Sad for the United Kingdom. Europe continues but it must react and regain the confidence of the people. This is an emergency.”

Former Sweden PM Carl Bildt called the result "beyond comprehension".

He also tweeted a picture of Nigel Farage saying “I dare to Dream” and added the message: “I would classify this as a nightmare.”

Cecilia Wikström, EU Parliamentary leader for the Swedish Liberal Party, told local media that Europe would be weakened by the UK's exit.

She said: "I regret that the UK now has decided to leave the EU.

"Europe will become much poorer, weaker and less competitive without them and Sweden have lost a close partner in the Union.

"The withdrawal will be a strong blow, especially against the British economy, but we must not allow the result of the referendum puts a spoke in the wheels of Europe's future."

The German Foreign office tweeted saying it was a "sad day for Europe" and called Britain's exit "sobering".

Dutch PM Mark Rutte said the out vote "must be stimulus for more reform in Europe".

 

He said the UK's decision seemed "irreversible" but warned it could take a long time.

An Irish government spokesman said the result has "very significant implications" for Ireland.

Its PM Enda Kenny is due to make statement later this morning.

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, looked and sounded forlorn at a press conference this morning.

He said he had contacted leaders of the remaining member states to arrange a meeting to discuss the future.

He said: “It’s true the last year has been the most difficult one in the history of our union.

“But I will always remember what my father used to tell me: ‘what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.”

The shockwaves of the Out vote are being felt on the other side of the globe.

Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he is "confident" that his country can weather the UK’s departure from the EU and says he will push on with trade negotiations.

He said: "I have no doubt that in due course the British Government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union," the Prime Minister said.

"This could take several years, and in the meantime, I have no doubt that our relations with the United Kingdom, which are as close as any two nations' relations could be, will continue as positively and intimately as ever.

"Equally, with Europe, we have been negotiating a European free trade agreement, and built strong ties with the countries of continental Europe, in particular France and Germany, and I'm confident that our negotiations towards a free trade agreement with the European Union will continue.

"So there is no cause for Australians to be alarmed by these developments."
