Theresa May vows to tackle ‘patchy’ MPs’ security after Jo Cox murder

2016-6-20

THE Home Secretary and senior police chiefs today pledged to tackle a “patchy” security service for MPs in a security summit at Parliament.

Frustrated politicians from all parties flagged up stalking and harassment fears in front of Theresa May, Commons leader Chris Grayling and senior Met commissioners in a private hearing.

A Home Office source said: “There was a desire for greater co-ordination between different police sources in the way that they deal with issues surrounding MPs security.”

Worried MPs voiced fears over “patchy” responses – blamed on having to deal with two police forces because most constituencies lie outside the Met force area.

And there were complaints about the “cumbersome” and “slow” implementation of enhanced security packages requested by members of parliament.

MPs have described confusion over how security measures are paid for.

It came as Jo Cox’s friend, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell said her “vile and unspeakable” killing should not lead to overly tight security for MPs in their constituencies.

The former international development secretary, who first met Mrs Cox in 2006 when they marched against the genocide in Darfur, said attacks on MPs are “as infrequent as they are disgraceful”.

Paying tribute to Mrs Cox as a “truly exceptional woman”, Mr Mitchell said: “I do not believe she would want this vile and unspeakable act to change the open and accessible relationship we enjoy with our constituents.

“All of us take the advice of our local police in protecting those who work and support us.

“Thankfully, the record shows these attacks are as infrequent as they are disgraceful.”
