Michael Gove and Boris Johnson pledge loyalty to David Cameron — even if Britain votes for Brexit

2016-6-19

One Cabinet Minister told the Sunday Times: “Several of us are talking about whether she should be a caretaker leader to get things back on an even keel.

In an interview on Saturday David Cameron insisted he would remain in No.10 even if the Britain votes Out on Thursday.

Experts believe his position would be untenable.

He added: “We had a stunning success at the last election… There’s no wet-dry, left right split in the Tory party.. I don’t think we’re going to get distracted now.”

My grave concern

A MUM who wanted Britain to quit the EU has paid for Brexit newspaper adverts — 19 years after herdeath.

Hilda Churchill, an ex-nurse who died in her 90s in 1997, asked son John to use money from his inheritance to campaign if there was ever a referendum.

He has spent £2,500 on local paper ads.

John, 78, of Stroud, Gloucs, revealed: “She said, ‘One day, use my money to get us out’.

“Mum was feisty and knew her mind.”

Exit's out for In pair

TWO Remain campaigners strolled naked in a city centre yesterday to “strip down the argument for Brexit”.

Sibi Moore, 25, wore Union Jack bodypaint and Claire Green, 23, was painted as an EU flag.

They gave out leaflets in Bristol, wearing nothing but skimpy knickers.

Sibi and Claire began their protest in front of a new mural of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump kissing.
