The embarrassing moment Kay Burley confused two black politicians LIVE on Sky News

2016-6-24

SKY News presenter Kay Burley made an embarrassing referendum night blunder when she confused two black politicians.

While reporting live Kay, 55, asked if the “man in the corner” was Labour MP David Lammy, 43.

But she was humiliatingly corrected by political reporter Beth Rigby, who pointed out it was actually ex-Equalities and Human Rights Commission chief Trevor Phillips, 62.

The gaffe prompted ridicule online, with viewer Jo Coles tweeting: “Kay Burley thought Trevor Phillips was David Lammy! #cringe.”

Simon Thompson added: “One is half the age of the other!"

And Ian Brindle insisted: “They look quite different.”

One shocked Twitter user said: "Kay Burley just mistook Trevor Phillips for David Lammy. cant blame her-they're pretty much twins-born 19yrs apart."

The cringe-worthy moment came after the polls had closed on the epic EU referendum campaign.

Early results suggest both the Leave and Remain campaigns are neck-and-neck.
