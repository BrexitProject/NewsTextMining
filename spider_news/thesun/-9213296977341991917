In the background people could be seen counting the ballot papers at the Grangemouth Sports Centre.

However, in the right-hand corner of the screen lay a set of double doors that bore a striking resemblance to the Nazi leader.

Haines wrote: "There is a door in Falkirk that looks like Hitler #bbc referendum."

Other Twitter users shared his opinion.

Magic Martial wrote: "Does anyone else think that this door looks like Hitler? LOL."

Nancy Von Short posted: "#HitlerDoor is winning the best #EUref moments so far."

Paul Tonner joked: "Interestingly enough, there's a door in Hitler that looks like Falkirk."

Other reporters covering the count were quick to take a selfie next to the door.

Andrew Learmouth, a freelance journalist, wrote: "Found the #hitlerdoor" with a picture of himself next to it.

The count at Grangemouth Sports Centre will tally the votes in the EU referendum for the Falkirk Council area in central Scotland.
