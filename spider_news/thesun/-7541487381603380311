Remain fell to as short as 1/10 in the morning before easing to 1/6.

Leave was given a mere 14 per cent chance of victory at one stage.

Separately Theresa May was installed as the new favourite to be the next Tory leader at 3/1.
A spokesman added: “Brexit the horse showed promise and was poised to challenge but ultimately ran out of steam with the finish line in sight.”
