2016-6-20

FOOTAGE has emerged of Jo Cox warning “women don’t feel safe on the streets” in her constituency where she was gunned down and stabbed in broad daylight.

The chilling video clip shows the Labour MP for Batley and Spen discussing how to prevent far-right attacks on young Muslim women in her area.

Speaking out against Islamophobia, she said it was "particularly affecting many of our younger women who don't feel as safe as they should when they’re out on the streets of Batley and Spen".

The popular mother-of-two was shot and stabbed outside a library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she was holding a constituency advice surgery.

The clip was filmed as part of a report by TellMAMA, an organisation that monitors anti-Muslim incidents, warns of rising aggression by nationalist militants and an increase in Islamophobia in the last year.

Last night it emerged Mrs Cox had been planning to release a report on the threat of the far right.

The report warned of rising aggression by far-right nationalists and an increase in Islamophobia in the last year.

She had been planning to raise the issue in parliament later this month, according to The Times.

The study is expected to conclude that there were about 80 per cent more attacks on Muslims in Britain in 2015 than the year before.
