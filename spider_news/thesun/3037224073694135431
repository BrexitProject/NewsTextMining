Boris Johnson accidentally gets chummy with ex-EDL man as he visits fish factory on Brexit battle bus

2016-6-16

BORIS Johnson signed Vote Leave posters for an activist covered with EDL tattoos today on a visit to a fish factory.

The Brexiteer posed for pics with former organiser and dad-of-six Andy Reynolds.

Quizzed over the tattoos, he said they were from "years ago”.

And asked when he was in the EDL, he added: “It doesn't matter, does it?”

Mr Reynolds described Boris as a "great man, going forward" with a "fantastic” message.

And he added: “The fishermen have been struggling for years so it's good to see someone highlighting it now.”

Asked if he had been politically active before campaigning for Vote Leave he replied: “Nah, nah, nah – first time.”

Mr Reynolds said he was voting To quit the EU “for my kids' futures, they're struggling with housing jobs – what future have they got?”

A Vote Leave spokesman said today: "Members and former members of the EDL are not welcome in the Vote Leave campaign.”

Mr Johnson had been in Lowestoft, Suffolk as the Vote Leave battle bus started its tour of East Anglia.

The Tory MP declared "they're pinching our fish" as he posed for photos while holding a live lobster, before then attempting to fillet a salmon.

And while at the factory he got his fish mixed up, thinking a farmed salmon was from Norway.

Speaking at the Sam Cole Food Group to people involved in the fishing industry, Mr Johnson said he is campaigning for Britain to "take back control" of its waters and ensure North Sea fish is more fairly distributed.

The former London mayor said: "We think we'd get more boats coming to Lowestoft."

He added: "We hope that carries your core support."

John Knights, who has a fishing boat in Lowestoft docks, said: "As long as you end up Prime Minister."

But Mr Johnson replied: "No, that's not going to happen."
