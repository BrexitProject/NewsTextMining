BBC viewers slam Jeremy Vine’s ‘distracting’ referendum infographics

2016-6-24

JEREMY Vine's famous 3D graphics outraged BBC viewers last night as they slammed the technology as "distracting".

Tens of thousands of Britons stayed awake long enough to watch the result of the historic EU referendum.

But for some, the BBC's coverage hosted by David Dimbleby and Emily Maitlis was ruined by charts and graphs that were "meaningless and incomprehensible".

Others even joked that the infographic designers were "drunk" when they made the colourful and complex graphics that are meant to offer a breakdown of votes during the night.

Every election Jeremy Vine is rolled out to stand on a colour-coded map on the floor showing how each region voted.

However, the referendum coverage proved to be too much for viewers, who questioned how much the BBC had spent on the technology.

One said:  "How much money does the bbc spend on these fancy graphics? It wouldn't be so bad if they actually helped you understand what's happening."

Another joked: "BBC news right now is showing what happens when infographic designers get drunk at work."

"These BBC graphics. It's like the late 90s on ketamine," added someone else.

The criticism came as Leave shockingly came from behind to win.

The final result saw 17,759,184 Brits vote to leave, while 16,580,508 backed remain.

And the shock decision plunged the financial markets into unprecedented chaos.

The pound plummeted by almost 10% across the night - a 31 year low - and the London stock exchange was expected to see a major crash today.

The pro-EU Prime Minister’s future was also put in major doubt, with Labour and some Lib Dems already calling for him to resign.
