Loose Women back in the studio filming secret show after being forced off-air

2016-6-24

LOOSE Women was pulled off air today in light of the Prime Minister resigning following the EU referendum result – however two of its regular panellists tweeted about filming going ahead.

Stacey Solomon and Nadia Sawalha both took to Twitter about recording the popular ITV show today despite the fact it was not on - so what were they filming?

 

The Sun Online can exclusively reveal that the ladies were in fact filming an 'emergency back-up' show, so that no matter what, the programme can go on air as scheduled at all times – regardless of any situation.

An insider revealed: “Stacey and Nadia were two of the stars filming the show today. It has been made in the event of an emergency happening, in light of recent events like the fire at ITV which led to Good Morning Britain being pulled off air.

“This secret back up show is so they are prepared for any eventuality.”

@loosewomen excited to be filming with the girls today! No live show, but still get to have a natter and laughs with lovely people ☀️😍💛

Earlier this year Good Morning Britain was forced off air after a fire broke in the ITV studios.

Kate Garraway, Ben Shephard and Ranvir Singh were forced out into the cold after fifty staff were evacuated from the blaze in a post room.

GMB came off air just after 6am and was still off two and a half hours later, around the time fire crews managed to get the blaze under control.

 

 

 

Viewers were forced to sit through a compilation of interviews with Ed Sheeran, Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron, before the show was replaced with a repeat of Dinner Date.

The pre-recorded show will hopefully prevent a situation like that occurring again.

we won't be live but we are still doing the show !

Stacey and Nadia both left fans – who were upset about the show not being on -  confused when they tweeted about recording the show still.

One-time X Factor star Stacey wrote: “Excited to be filming with the girls today! No live show, but still get to have a natter and laughs with lovely people.”

While Nadia told a fan: “We won't be live but we are still doing the show!”

The women then recorded a video for their fans showing them all in the studio – discussing why the show was not on.

Kay Adams said: “We are really disappointed we are not with you today. As you can see we are live ready to go but there is a little thing happening politically which you all know about – the EU referendum – so it means we are not on today.”

June Sarpong gave her view on the result, admitting: “I’m devastated, absolutely devastated. I think what is about to unfold in our country is very scary and I think a lot of people are going to be worse hit unfortunately.”

Stacey was a little more upbeat, saying: “I am just disappointed that we don’t get to go on today. I am thinking a lot about the referendum but also all the people who miss out on this.”

An official spokesperson for Loose Women confirmed to The Sun Online: "Loose Women filmed a pre-recorded show to be used at a later date."
