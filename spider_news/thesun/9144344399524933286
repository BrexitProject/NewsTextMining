EU Referendum: Vote to leave could see Paul Pogba cost Manchester United or Chelsea £20million more

2016-6-23

PAUL POGBA could cost Manchester United or Chelsea up top £20million more if Britain votes to leave the EU.

Top clubs in the UK are at risk of being hit hard should the referendum decide that the nation should go it alone.

Experts predict the value of the pound against the euro would suffer a sharp fall – and that would hit Premier League clubs hard when they want to do deals with European clubs.

At current exchange rates, Pogba’s 160m euro value would mean interested clubs United and Chelsea have to find around £123m to get their man.

But economists believe the pound could drop to 0.9 against the euro, and if that were to happen it would see Pogba’s price rising to £144m.

Chelsea are also keen on signing Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, and are battling Arsenal for the signature of the striker valued at 70m euros.

If were to pay that fee today it would stand at £54m – but could rise to £63m if the result of today’s vote goes in favour of the leave camp.

All clubs would be hit further if players start to demand their wages are calculated in euros rather than pounds when they negotiate contracts.

And to compound the problem, it would make it cheaper for European clubs to buy players from the UK.

It means English clubs are all waiting anxiously to discover the outcome of the vote, which is likely to be announced on Friday morning.
