Queen in emergency Brexit talks with David Cameron to avert crisis after shock of Out vote

2016-6-24

THE Queen held emergency Brexit talks with David Cameron yesterday in a bid to stop her from being sucked into a constitutional crisis next week.

In disastrous diary scheduling, Her Majesty will visit both Northern Ireland and Scotland in the next seven days.

The trips include delivering a major speech to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

The two home nations both voted by big majorities to remain in the EU on Thursday, while England and Wales backed Brexit.

Palace aides are locked in a dilemma, as they fear anything Her Majesty says about the referendum result will spark uproar after The Sun revealed her strong Eurosceptic views in March.

But they also think her not mentioning the massive historic vote will be seen as insensitive.

Mr Cameron tried to thrash out the problem with the Queen during his 30 minute audience with her at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning.

They agreed she would make no public comment yesterday about the Brexit result, a senior Whitehall source last night told The Sun.

But if the nation had voted to stay in the EU, the plan was for her to have welcomed the different outcome.

The source said: “The palace are massively worried about a new Scottish and possibly a Northern Irish referendum, and then the complete dissolution of the United Kingdom.

“Her Majesty would see that as a complete disaster, and she doesn’t want to say or do anything to contribute to it.”

It has also been suggested that the Prince of Wales could make her Edinburgh speech, but the Queen personally dismissed the idea.

Buckingham Palace last night insisted the Scotland and Northern Ireland trips have been long scheduled.

The Queen’s spokeswoman said: “The referendum is a matter for the people of the UK and the Queen is above politics”.
