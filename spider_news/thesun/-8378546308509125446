Lord Sugar blasted by Remain camp for ‘racist’ attack on Brexit-backing German MP

2016-6-22

THE Remain campaign was hit by extraordinary infighting last night as Lord Alan Sugar was accused of racism for saying a leading Brexiteer should not “tell us British what we should do” because she is from Germany.

The millionaire businessman was attacking Bavarian-born MP Gisela Stuart, who moved to the UK in 1974, as she took to the stage in last night’s major TV debate for the Leave campaign.

Referring to Mrs Stuart by her maiden name, Lord Sugar tweeted:

I find it strange that Gisela Gschaider a 1974 immigrant  from Germany  is on the brexit panel telling us British what we should do .

He added: “She immigrated to UK from Germany in 1974. 30 mins ago was advocating that we stop immigration from the EU.”

Twitter users blasted the TV reality star for his “racist” comment, with former Tory MP Louise Mensch calling him a “pig”.

He was swiftly slammed by his own side, with James McGrory, spokesman for the official Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, saying his remarks were “utterly unacceptable”.

This is utterly unacceptable. I couldn't disagree with Gisela Stuart more but she has every right to say her piece. https://t.co/ReC4ABFuD7

Tory MP and Leave backer Nadhim Zahawi said:

@Lord_Sugar You must withdraw and apologise to Gisela. That is disgraceful. She is as British as you are.

Ms Stuart, Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, moved to the UK at the age of 19. She is now a British citizen.

Denying his comment was racist, he hit back at one Twitter user:  "You ignorant fool. How can my comment be classified as racist.

“Crawl back under your rock."

Mrs Stuart is one of the most high profile Labour voices on the official Vote Leave campaign and appeared alongside former Mayor of London Boris Johnson and energy minister Andrea Leadsom in an BBC debate in front of 6,000 people at Wembley Arena.
