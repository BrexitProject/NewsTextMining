Jermaine Pennant Tweets about Brexit asking if England will be allowed in the next Euros

2016-6-24

JERMAINE PENNANT tweeted asking if England would still be allowed to play in the Euros after voting leave in the referendum.

The former Arsenal, Liverpool and Stoke City winger then claimed it was all a big wind up – but not until first deleting the tweet.





Pennant, who plays for Tampines Rovers in Singapore, asked his followers: “Now we are not in Europe what’s going to happen with the next euros 2018??? #eu”.

Eagle eyed followers quickly took screen shots of the confused Tweet – it’s the World Cup in 2018, not the Euros – before Pennant deleted it.

In a series of tweets he then claimed he had been on the wind up all along, throwing bait out to spark a reaction.



But followers were not so convinced.

They were also confused as why he would so quickly delete the tweet if it was just a big joke all along.

One wrote: “Yeah of course you were joking. Trying too hard, lad. Nobody is actually believing you.”

While another said: “hahahaha classic, so it was all a joke. Honestly you’re like a 10 year old. ONLY JOKING.

“Course you were, of course you were…”

Pennant last played in the Premier League with Stoke City on New Year’s Day, 2014.
