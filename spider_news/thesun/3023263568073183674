2016-6-22

LABOUR MP Yvette Cooper has alerted police after receiving a vile death threat against her children and grandchildren.

The former Cabinet minister was sent the sinister message on Twitter from an account that accused her of sending pro-EU "propaganda" by email.

It added: "Please stop or I will kill your kids and grandkids."

Reposting the threatening tweet to her followers, Ms Cooper commented: "Got this today for speaking out for Remain ... This has to stop".

It is understood the account was removed after the MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford reported the tweet.

She told her followers: "Police & @Twitter on case. But this is for all of us. Time to stop the hatred."

The incident comes amid an increase in security for MPs following the death of Ms Cooper's Labour colleague and fellow West Yorkshire MP Jo Cox.

The MP died after being shot and stabbed in an attack in Birstall near Leeds on Thursday last week.

A man has been remanded in custody after being charged with her murder.
