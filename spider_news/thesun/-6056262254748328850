Leave campaigner, 80, arrested after painting ‘Vote Leave’ in two-foot high letters around his hometown

2016-6-19

FORMER councillor John Kapp has been arrested after cops caught him daubing “Vote Leave” in white paint on a prominent billboard by a main road in Sussex.

Kapp was arrested for criminal damage after painting two-foot high letters on three commercial adverts, seven buildings, and on the side of a skip.

Officers have released the veteran campaigner on bail while they investigate his actions — on the condition he does not leave home with a paintbrush and pot of paint.

Speaking on his arrest in an interview with The Argus, the lifelong Tory said he painted the message on billboards so lots of people would see them.

Kapp, 80, said he defaced the public property as he was “disgusted” at the alleged scaremongering tactics by David Cameron and the Remain campaign.

The OAP was arrested at 8am on Saturday morning while he was painting the slogan on a billboard near a branch of B&Q on Brighton Road in Shoreham.

Kapp explained his motives: "I've had a Vote Leave sticker in my window for weeks now but hardly anyone goes down the road where I live, so I thought I'd choose the A259 where lots of people will see it."

A Sussex Police spokesman said: “An 80-year-old man from Hove has been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.

"He has been bailed until Saturday July 9 while enquiries continue."
