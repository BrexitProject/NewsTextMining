How voters in Labour’s Wales heartlands turned their backs on Remain camp

2016-6-24

WELSH voters led a shock stampede for Brexit as they “landed a blow on the political establishment”.

Just four out of 22 areas looked set to back Remain in a massive “wake-up call” to the Westminster-knows-best culture, leading politicians said.

Labour heartlands revolted against their pro-EU leaders as swathes of the South Wales valleys and even second city Swansea voted to Leave.

Welsh Tory Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb said the huge Leave vote was “a large number of voters saying ‘sorry, we just don’t believe the Labour Party or the

Government in the way they tell us that Europe and the European Union is good for us’”.

And he said the white working classes “just haven’t trusted” what senior politicians were telling them.

That was echoed by Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood who said the Brexit backing was a sign “people are not satisfied with the status quo”.

She added: “There was very strong feeling from people that they want change. The EU referendum is an opportunity to do that - to land a blow on the political establishment.”

Labour former minister Lord Hain said: “The strong Leave vote demonstrates the serious extent of left-behind alienation in Labour areas, at Wales’ economic and social prospects and deep antagonism to the UK Tory government which invited a kicking in this referendum and are being given it”.
