#DogsAtPollingStations are back as pooches defy the miserable British weather and liven up the EU vote

2016-6-23

VOTERS have livened up the European Union referendum vote by bringing their dogs out in force to polling stations across the country.

These pooches defied the miserable British weather and lined up for the historic referendum.

Users are sharing their pictures on Twitter with the hashtag: #DogsAtPollingStations

The hashtag originally went viral last year at the 2015 General Elections when it was confirmed polling stations would be dog-friendly places.

Judging by today's tweets, the pets have distracted voters from the gray weather and the duller aspects of politics.

One Twitter user wrote: "As always #dogsatpollingstations is the best part of voting day."

Elena Cresci tweeted: "#dogsatpollingstations make democracy worth the effort."
