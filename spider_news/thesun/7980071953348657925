Jo Cox’s devastated husband urged to take her seat in Parliament

2016-6-17

JO Cox’s heartbroken husband is being urged by political friends to stand as an MP in the seat she held.

Charity consultant Brendan Cox is already being seen as the perfect replacement for her in the safe Labour constituency of Batley and Spen.

The 37-year-old former Labour special adviser who once worked in No10 has been an activist since his student days.

Mr Cox also won huge plaudits for his moving statement honouring his wife and calling for Britain to reject hate just a few hours after her death.

A Labour MP who was close to Jo told The Sun: “It is very early days, and Brendan will want to give this a lot of serious thought – not least, about how he will look after his young children.

“But in a lot of people’s view already, he would be the perfect replacement for Jo.

“It would also be a lovely thing to honour her legacy of internationalism and helping the needy around the world which Brendan fully shares.”

A by-election to pick Jo Cox’s successor for the West Yorks constituency is likely to be held either next month or in September after the summer holidays.

The Conservatives, the Lib Dems and UKIP all said yesterday they wouldn’t contest the seat in a tribute to Jo.

A Tory spokesman said giving Labour a free run at holding the seat would be “a mark of respect to a much-loved and respected politician”.

Earlier this year, Gill Furniss succeeded her husband Harry Harpham as Labour MP for Sheffield Brightside after he died of cancer.
