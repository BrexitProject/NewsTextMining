Lib Dem leader recreates John Barnes rap from World In Motion

2016-6-22

Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has been spitting rhymes on his campaign bus ahead of the EU referendum.

The musically-gifted party leader has sent social media into a state of cringe after performing footballer John Barnes’ rap from the 1990 World Cup song World In Motion.

Former Three Lions winger Barnes told Sky News yesterday that he was voting to remain in the EU after Justice Secretary Michael Gove wrongly claimed that he was pro-Brexit.

Talented Farron posted his ‘tribute’ to the Liverpool and Watford legend on Twitter along with the caption:  “A tribute to John Barnes from Team #INtogether. @officialbarnesy #VoteRemain #EUref #Strongerin.”

The street-wise politician is pictured on his ‘IN’ campaign bus along with a group of young campaigners who seem to be enjoying his tight-rapping skills.

Footballer Barnes, who famously rapped a verse of the New Order penned football song, yesterday slammed claims by euro-sceptic Gove that he supported the Leave campaign.

He said: “How this happened was I gave an interview stating that for English football it would be better off being out of the EU because, of course, we couldn’t get all of these European players coming in as easily, so it would be better for English footballers.

“That was then misinterpreted as I’m supporting the Leave campaign.

“I got a call the very next day, this is about a month ago, saying ‘oh thank you very much for your support’ – and I made it categorically clear that speaking from the point of view of English footballers, it would be better off, but I don’t support the Leave campaign because that’s a very selfish view of me looking just at English football.

“I’ve got to think about what I think is right for the country. I made it plain that I do not support them, I support Remain.”
