Chris Bryant says he might PUNCH Ed Miliband for ‘leaving Labour in the state it’s in’

2016-6-24

ED Miliband has been threatened with a PUNCH from a senior Labour MP who called him a "t***pot" as he gave a live TV interview.

Chris Bryant, shadow leader of the House of Commons, hit out at his former party leader at the Stronger In referendum party.

As the Doncaster North MP appeared on the big screen behind him, Bryant said: "I might go and punch him because he's a t***pot and he left the party in the state it's in."

Miliband was telling ITV News that the EU has to change if Britain votes to remain in the institution.

He said: "If any member of the British establishment thinks...we can go back to business as usual, they're wrong.

"Where Jeremy [Corbyn] has been saying we need a more progressive Europe, a more social Europe, one that actually speaks to some of the terrible unemployment across Europe...that is in the vicinity of what's right on this."

Bryant's outbursts has heightened the bitter divide in the Labour party since leader Jeremy Corbyn was voted in.

Former Eurosceptic Corbyn admitted he was "not a lover" of the EU while backing the IN camp over the past few months.

But he's been criticised for taking a backseat during the campaign.

His predecessor Miliband told critics Corbyn's stance was similar to the "reluctant" view of the British people.

Britain's Brexit was officially confirmed just before 6am, after a number of victories against the odds have propelled the chance of a win for Leave in the EU referendum.

The country had been split down the middle after historic wins for the Out campaign in Wales, the South and the North East were cancelled out by boosts for Remain in Scotland and London.
