Boris waves off ‘Project Fear’ attacks from Sadiq Khan during EU debate at Wembley

2016-6-21

LEAVE campaign chief Boris Johnson last night batted off waves of Project Fear attacks  during the final EU TV debate with the jibe: “There they go again."

The Tory pinched former US President Ronald Reagan’s famous line to hit back at his three pro-EU opponents.

The 100-minute BBC1 debate saw bitter clashes between BoJo and his successor as London Mayor, Sadiq Khan.

Mr Khan, TUC chief Frances O’Grady and Scots Tories leader Ruth Davidson pounded him with barbs in a bid to plant doubt about the Brexit message.

But Mr Johnson won huge cheers at the SSE Arena in Wembley when he replied: “It hasn’t taken them long.

“They began by telling us they would have a positive and patriotic case, and they are back to Project Fear within moments of this debate beginning.”

The two teams faced a grilling on three areas — the economy, immigration and the UK’s place in the world.

Mr Khan accused Mr Johnson and the Brexiteers of telling “one lie after another” and also accused him of “suddenly changing your lines”.

Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom branded the EU “a disaster for our trade with the rest of the world”.

Both sides claimed they got the upper-hand on their debate opponents.


Meanwhile, Michael Gove compared Government-cited economists rubbishing Brexit to those used by the Nazis to smear Albert Einstein in the 1930s.

He told LBC: “They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the Government to say that he was wrong and Einstein said, ‘Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough’.”
