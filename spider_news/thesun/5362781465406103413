Corbyn calls for ‘more tolerant society’ as lasting tribute to murdered MP Jo Cox

2016-6-19

CREATING a more tolerant society is the best way to remember murdered MP Jo Cox, says Jeremy Corbyn.

Speaking on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show the Labour leader paid tribute to the married mother-of-two who was killed outside her surgery on Thursday afternoon.

He said: “She was very passionate, very committed.

“We’ve lost a great talent, we’ve lost somebody with vision who spoke up in Parliament for human rights, who spoke up for peace in Syria and so many other places.

“An MP has died and it’s an attack on all of us. In her memory we have to create a more tolerant society.”

Mr Corbyn laid flowers at the memorial in the centre of Birstall on Friday afternoon alongside the Prime Minister David Cameron.

He added: “I was there on Friday for a vigil and what struck me was the unity of the crowd, all ethnic groups, everybody there together, totally shocked and in grief at what happened because this was a murder of her but it was also an attack on democracy, an attack on the right of somebody to be elected to represent you and to go about their business.”

And Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he first met her during her first week in Parliament when they were queuing to get a cup of tea.

He said: “She was an amazing and wonderful person."

Mr Gove added: “She spoke with great passion and effectiveness, she campaigned for causes she believed in with a great heart and I think she was the sort of person that I think all of us would want our daughters to grow up to be like.

“She was an amazing person. I can only grieve for her and in particular think of her poor children and her bereaved husband.

“I know they’re in the thoughts and prayers of many of us at this time.”
