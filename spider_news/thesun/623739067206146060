Now even one of Labour’s top team wants Out of the EU in a fresh blow to Remain campaign

2016-6-16

A SENIOR member of Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench team has become the first to break ranks and back Brexit.

Lefty John Cryer risks the sack from the Shadow Cabinet after he declared: “The EU is not Europe but a political construct imposed on many countries.”

As chairman of the powerful Parliamentary Labour Party group of MPs, Mr Cryer’s comments are set to spark uproar amongst his pro-EU colleagues.

Last week he was warned his job was under threat if he backed Leave, but he yesterday he became the tenth Labour MP to do so.

In an article for a local website in East London, the boss of the Parliamentary Labour Party raged that the EU “is undermining democratic governments, weakening national boundaries and handing power to the markets and the corporate world.”

He added: “Along with a majority of the British people, I think a referendum on our membership is long overdue.

“This is not because I am a fan of referenda, but if parliament decides to change the power of the ballot box and the power of Westminster, that should be put to the voters.”

He raged that “the EU will continue as the same centralised monolith that it has always been.

“Eurozone states, who are really under the cosh of the Euro-sadists, are now being told that they will lose control over their own budgets; they have already, of course, lost control of their currency by joining the Euro in the first place.

“Brussels is also indicating that there should be more “harmonising” of taxation.”

The lifelong lefty and MP for Leyton, East London describes himself as “a critic of the European Union because it is anti-democratic.”

In 2011 he attacked Brussels as “a tiny political elite at the apex of the European Union which says: “This doesn’t matter. We don’t want people having their views on Europe tested. We don’t want to have to go out to seek people’s opinions.”
