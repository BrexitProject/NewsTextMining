‘We only agree on sandwich spread, the old Mondeo and Europe’ Jeremy Clarkson and James May unite to back Remain in the EU referendum in hilarious video

2016-6-20

JEREMY Clarkson and James May have put aside their “normal police” of disagreeing with each other to unite in urging voters to reject Brexit in the EU referendum.

The ex-Top Gear stars appear in a video for the official Remain campaign saying their new show would be more difficult if we quit Brussels on Thursday.

The pair said the only things they agree on are “that sandwich spread is delicious”, the “old Ford Mondeo was a good car”, and “Europe”.

Standing in front of a map of the continent May says: “This is Europe and we Jeremy are… fond of it."

Clarkson says: “It annoys me I'll be honest, because I want to remain in Europe but that means agreeing with him.”

May adds: “This is very uncharacteristic - we have to put aside the normal policy of our TV show and our relationship and agree on something.

“Apart from the Ford Mondeo is a good car.”

“And that sandwich spread is delicious,” adds Clarkson.

The presenter says that making their new TV show The Grand Tour involves them filming in Europe, which would be a lot more difficult if we left the EU.

May add: “What Jeremy is essentially saying to transport our kit 21 miles [across the Channel] involves a pile of paperwork almost big enough to make a bridge.”

Clarkson says: “That why we don’t film in Switzerland, because of the carnage.”

The pair then proceed to have an argument about pen knives, and the film ends with a message from Britain Stronger In to vote to stay in the EU.
