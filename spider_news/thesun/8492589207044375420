Summer solstice and strawberry moon coincide for first time since 1967

2016-6-20

Today's summer solstice will coincide with a full moon in a stunning "once in a lifetime" event.

Tonight's night sky will be lit up by a "strawberry moon", which was given its name by Native Americans who believed it heralded the beginning of the strawberry growing season.

These two events rarely take place at the same time and last coincided in 1967.

Some 25,000 hippies and pagans are expected to flock to Stonehenge to celebrate the solstice, which is the longest day in the year.

But English Heritage has narked new age spiritualists by charging them £15 to enter Stonehenge and banning alcohol from the event.

The solstice marks the middle of summer, as days will begin to get shorter in length from now until December 21, when they will begin to lengthen again.

As with everything which happens in the heavens, the solstice has been heralded as a sign that doomsday is on the way.

Last week, astrologer Timothy Halloran said today's cosmic events would cause "madness, hallucinations and delusions of grandeur" in humans.

However, it could be argued that the EU Referendum has already had this effect on some residents of the United Kingdom.

"This is a critical time energetically," Halloran raged.

"This is a time when people go off the deep end, people lose control.

"People do go on shooting sprees. People do have to run into total insanity.

"This is a potent time. This is time a time when we are going to look back and remember the events - the transformations that are going on these days, as there is a lot of stuff that is lining up to make this moon quite potent.

The astrologer's bizarre claims led Twitter jokers to mockingly accuse conspiracy theorists of "moon shaming".
