Jeremy Corbyn proved himself to be Leave’s secret weapon again with bizarre appeal for voters to reject Brexit

2016-6-16

PRO-EU Jeremy Corbyn today warned Brussels to change or face a public revolt – in a bizarre appeal for voters to reject Brexit.

In another disastrous intervention for the Remain campaign, the Labour leader called for a crippling European banking tax on the City, a Europe-wide minimum wage and more EU red tape.

At a speech in Rotherham he urged the UK to lead in showing “what the European Union can become” by remaining and then pressing for reform.

But he followed that with a peculiar “warning for Europe”, saying: “Whatever the outcome of next week’s referendum, the EU must demonstrate its continued relevance to its people or it will be rejected.”

Mr Corbyn - who has been criticised for his lacklustre pro-EU campaigning - also said many voters are leaning towards Brexit because they “haven’t understood” the benefits Europe brings or the risks of leaving.

And he told them not to “blame” immigrants for Britain’s problems.

His speech formed part of a last-ditch Labour blitz to stop its voters leading the UK out of the exit door before campaigning was suspended after MP Jo Cox was tragically shot dead in a Yorkshire street.

Ex-PM Gordon Brown and current Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell joined forces in Manchester to warn quitting Brussels would hit jobs and investment in the north.

Election-losing former leader Lord Kinnock was also wheeled out in a bid to shore up Labour support for Remain.
