Scots plot revolt as SNP ‘pledges Scotland will remain in EU even if UK votes Out’

2016-6-18

Nicola Sturgeon plans to defy the will of the British people if they back Brexit next week and demand Scotland stays in the EU, it was claimed yesterday.

Despite having no powers to do so, Alex Salmond said: “I would expect the Scottish Parliament to move quickly and, with the mandate given to it by the Scottish people, to negotiate its position within the EU and the single market which is vital for jobs and prosperity.”

The former First Minister added: “Whatever chaos — political or constitutional — envelops Westminster, I anticipate the First Minister will lead Scotland in that direction.”

But there are currently no powers at the Scottish Government’s disposal to make this a reality.

Nicola Sturgeon has told Members of the Scottish Parliament that officials were looking at “all options” to protect Scotland’s place within Europe.

But the nationalist leader, who is supporting the Remain campaign, refused to provide any detail about what those preparations involved.

Speaking in the Scottish Parliament this week, Ms Sturgeon said: “If Scotland faces the prospect of being taken out of the EU against our democratically expressed will, then all options to protect our relationship with Europe and the EU will require to be considered.”

The Scottish Government later added that all “political and diplomatic” means would be used to try keep Scotland within the EU in the event of a Brexit.

Scottish officials believe they would be able to convince the European Commission that Scotland could stay if the rest of the UK left, despite having no official powers to negotiate on the international stage.
