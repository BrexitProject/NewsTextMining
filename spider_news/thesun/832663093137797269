Liam Fox asks Brits to consider how they might have voted at the last EU poll

2016-6-19

It is 41 years since our last referendum on Europe and no one under 58 years of age has ever had a say on this aspect of Britainâ€™s future.

Those who are still undecided should ask themselves one simple question: if we were not already a member of the EU, would you choose to join it next Thursday?

Would you choose to give away the ability to make our own laws, with an unelected European Court able to overrule our own democratically elected Parliament?

Would you voluntarily give away control of our borders so that an unlimited number of EU citizens could settle here, as 184,000 did last year, bringing new demands on school places, GPS and housing?

Would you choose to send billions of pounds of taxpayers money to an unelected European Commission each year, rather than spending it on our own priorities here at home?

Would you want to see a European army undermining Nato and our transatlantic alliance?

If you would not choose to join now, why choose to stay?

The future depends on your choice.
