Polling station decked out with national flags is compared to EDL rally as voters complain of Brexit bias

2016-6-23

A POLLING station has been ordered to remove England flags after voters compared to it to an EDL rally and claimed Brexit bias.

Pictures of Mayfield Athletic Club in Enfield, north London, decked out in St George's flags emerged on Twitter today.

The elections watchdog told MailOnline the station had not breached electoral law, but they advised the venue to take down the flags to avoid confrontation and further concerns from voters.

It also told the polling station to switch off the TV, which was showing rolling coverage.

Another polling station in Harrow was accused of bias after hanging up Union Jack flags.

Voter Carly Minsky said it was "pretty overt manipulation."

Guidance published by the Electoral Commission states that polling stations "must not wear any badges, slogans or colours that might bring your impartiality into question."

A spokesman for Enfield Council said the cricket club had put up the flags because it was screening Euro 2016 football games.

Earlier today, a UKIP supporter got police attention after handing out pens at a Winchester polling station.

Many Leave voters are convinced their vote will be altered: a Yougov poll found 46 percent of Brexiteers feel this way, while a third of UKIP voters fear MI5 may be involved.
