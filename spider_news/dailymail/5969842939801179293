2016-6-21

One of the Brexit campaign's biggest donors is a former member of the British National Party, it was revealed today.

Gladys Brammall has donated a total of £600,000 to Vote Leave – the designated Brexit group – over the last two months.

The 88-year-old woman from Sutton Coldfield was revealed as a BNP member when her name and address appeared in the party's membership list after it was leaked by Wikileaks in 2006.

Ms Brammall refused to give a comment to MailOnline when we contacted her this afternoon. 

One of the Brexit campaign's biggest donors is a former member of the British National Party, it was revealed today. Gladys Brammall has donated a total of £600,000 to Vote Leave – the designated Brexit group – over the last two months. The 88-year-old woman from Sutton Coldfield was revealed as a BNP member when her name and address appeared in the party's membership list after it was leaked by Wikileaks in 2006



According to Buzzfeed News, she had been signed as a member of the BNP by her husband, Leonard Brammall.

The wealthy couple held a majority shareholding in Construct Equip, a plant hire business based in the Midlands.

Ms Brammall made her first donation of £100,000 on 29 April and a second donation of £500,000 on May 9.

Vote Leave is now facing calls to return the money after last month stating it did not want support from the BNP. 

The group was forced to step in to ban a former top BNP official who had been using Vote Leave campaign material.

And yesterday Vote Leave was dealt a further blow when board member Arabella Arkwright retweeted anti-Islamic material, including an image of a white girl surrounded by a group of people wearing burqas along with the slogan: 'Britain 2015: Why didn't you stop them Grandad?' 

She has since resigned from Vote Leave's board.  

Rival campaign group Britain Stronger In Europe demanded Vote Leave returns the £600,000 donations. 

Sam Gyimah, a pro-EU Tory education minister, said: 'It's extremely concerning that Vote Leave have received so much money from a former member of the BNP an abhorrent organisation.

'By accepting this money they risk associating themselves with these views, especially following the resignation of one of their board members after she re-tweeted far right material. They must now return the donation immediately.' 



Mark Collett and his girlfriend Eva Van Housen - who has a swastika tattoo on her chest, were found handing out leaflets and badges from a stall decked out in Vote Leave branding.  

Ms Brammall's latest donation was revealed in the latest publication of donations to EU referendum campaigns today. 

In total, groups backing Brexit have received £15.6million since February 1 and groups campaigning for the UK to stay in the EU have raked in £11.9million

The figures showed thatBrexit campaigners are winning the funding battle in the EU referendum war, with groups backing a British exit from the EU raking in £3.6million over the last month, while campaigns supporting Britain staying in the EU received £2.9million between May 13 and June 9. 

With less than 48 hours left until polls open for Thursday's historic referendum, the latest donations - published by the Electoral Commission this afternoon - show the Brexit campaign is continuing to attract the biggest donations. 

In total, groups backing Brexit have received £15.6million since February 1 and groups campaigning for the UK to stay in the EU have raked in £11.9million.   

Vote Leave - the designated lead campaign group - attracted £2.7million in donations in the latest period - nearly as much as the total donations for Remain campaigns. 

Their formal rival Britain Stronger in Europe - formally known as The In Campaign Ltd - received £1.9million. 

Today's figures show both official campaigns have now received more than the £7million they are allowed to spend in the campaign period that began on April 15 and culminates on Thursday. 

And there is still another set of donations to declare for all funding received since June 10. It is unknown what the campaigns will do with the leftover cash.

So far, a staggering £27,478,793 has been donated to the EU referendum campaigns in total since February 1 - with a further £6.1million in borrowing.   

In the latest period of donations comedian and Remain activist Eddie Izzard received a £8,250 donation. 

He has played an active role in campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU but was humiliated earlier this month when he was told to 'shut up' by the audience on Question Time after ranting at Nigel Farage over immigration. 

Other campaign groups to receive large donations over the last month include £480,000 going to the advertising campaign group Brexit Express and the Grassroots Out campaign, run and backed by several Tory MPs, received £125,000. 

The Labour Leave campaign attracted £100,000, while another Tory campaign, the Bruges Group, received £30,000. 



Trade Unionists Against The European Union received £18,000 and another Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was given £50,000. 

There were also big donations to their rivals on the Remain side, with the Best for Our Future group receiving £179,000 over the last month, Conservatives In received £321,792 and the Wake Up and Vote group received £100,000. 

The pro-Brussels We Are Europe group, which has produced videos with actors Keira Knightley and Lily Cole and musicians Eliza Doolittle and Big Narstie, received £164,000 between May 13 and June 9. 

The designated campaigns - Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave - each have a maximum spending allowance of £7million during the referendum. 

Other registered campaigns can spend up to £700,000 while unregistered campaigns can spend £10,000.
