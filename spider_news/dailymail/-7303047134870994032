Queuin' in the rain! Hundreds of soggy commuters wait in downpour to get into Waterloo station as dozens of cancellations cause yet more misery 

2016-6-23



Commuters in the evening rush hour are drowning in chaos after torrential rain and thunderstorms forced the closure of hundreds of routes home across Britain.

Roads in the capital have been described as being 'like a swimming pool', while London Underground and rail services were crippled by flash flooding brought on by the bad weather. 

It saw parts of London and the South East swamped with a deluge of water on an historic day for the country - as voters headed to the polls to decide whether Britain should stay in or leave the EU. In Romford, East London, some residents even had to be rescued from their homes by boat.

After a brief hiatus in mid-afternoon, heavy rain resumed once more in the south of England, East Anglia and the Home Counties during the evening rush hour.

Keep the brolly ready! As the overnight floods began to recede forecasters issued a dire warning for people to prepare for worse to come. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are predicated to hit the south of England, East Anglia and the Home Counties during the evening rush hour

Experts warned commuters in south-east England to consider leaving work early amid fears there will be more to delays and cancellations on rail, roads and the Tube.  

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operating companies and Network Rail, advised passengers travelling through affected areas that 'services will be severely disrupted this evening'. 



He went on: 'Passengers should check before they travel and consider travelling earlier if they can in order to get home.'

That did not stop thousands of workers getting caught up in the chaos as trains and underground services were brought to a halt by lightning strikes and flooding.

At Waterloo - Britain's busiest station - all routes were affected by severe delays, cancellations and alterations - with hundreds of train users forced to queue outside as the departures hall became full to capacity. 

Travel warnings followed 'immediate action' flood warnings issued this morning for parts of south east London and Essex while areas of the capital saw a month's rainfall in a matter of hours.

London Fire Brigade  said it had received more than 500 calls to reports of weather-related incidents including lightning striking property, flooded homes and businesses and rising waters trapping vehicles. The fire service was so inundated with calls it answered a day's worth in just 90 minutes.

There were reports of flooded streets as storms swept through, threatening disruption as voters head to polling stations.

The storms brought widespread travel disruption across the south, with Abellio Greater Anglia, South West Trains and Southern all warning of major delays on some routes.

There was also major disruption to the capital's travel network, creating problems for thousands of commuters during the morning rush hour. 

Network Rail said it had 1,200 engineers working on weather-related issues across the network. 

Though the majority of services have been restored, this morning saw:

People took to social media site Twitter to post pictures and complain about how the thunderstorm was keeping them awake.

One, Usman Shah, wrote: 'Never seen anything like this! So much rain in London! And then thunder. And then lightning. And then POWER CUT. And then my bedroom floods!'

Another user tweeted: 'I don't remember #thunder and lightning like this in #London for years. Makes for very dramatic insomnia.'

London Underground: 

Metropolitan line: Severe delays

Bakerloo line: Part suspended, minor delays

Victoria line: Minor delays 

London Overground: Part suspended

Gatwick Express: Limited services

South West Trains, Southern and Abellio Greater Anglia: Minor disruption

TfL Rail: Severe delays

Tram: Part suspended

The District line, Circle line, DLR and London Overground were all suspended or delayed because of flooding.

Gatwick Express southbound services have been suspended because of 'poor weather'. South West Trains, Southern and TFL Rail are also suffering major delays because of the storms.

Many of London's roads were affected by localised flooding, including the North Circular which was closed at Waltham Forest.  

In Surrey, severe flooding in the Wandsworth Common area meant no Southern trains between Victoria and East Croydon. Southern tweeted at 7.35am that one line has now been reopened, although severe delays were expected throughout the busy morning period.

Several cancellations were reported on lines into London from many towns, including Oxted and Leatherhead. Redhill to Tonbridge trains were also suspended due to flooding in the Nutfield area.

To add to passengers' woes, signalling problems at Guildford Station were causing long delays on the line between Gatwick and Reading.

At West Norwood rail station two fire engines were called after smoke began pouring from the flooded track during rush hour. Commuters said they were evacuated from trains and had to continue their journey by bus. 

Trains are now running through the station but Southern warned services were subject to speed restrictions.

A couple set to be first-time parents in a month have been made homeless after flooding ravaged their ground-floor flat.

David Sandor and his wife Lidia, who is eight months pregnant, are due to have their first child on July 24 but now have to leave their Essex home for up to two months.

David's sister, Elizabeth Bodea, 28, who lives in a flat upstairs in the same block in Romford with her husband and another brother, said: 'The rain started around 1am and around 3am the ground floor was flooded because the drainage couldn't cope.

'It was pouring like I have never seen in my life. We phoned the emergency services but they said they had to go to people in greater need.

'I am worried about my sister-in-law because I wanted to be there to help her with the baby. They have just bought all the baby stuff and some of it was damaged.

'Thankfully most of it was upstairs as the flat is two floors but their kitchen is destroyed.'

Mrs Bodea shared a photo on social media of cars, including hers, submerged in flood water outside Linton Court.

Flooding overnight led to voters having to wade through water to cast their votes in today's EU in/out referendum. The rain was still coming down this morning as polls opened across the country.

And the rising waters eventually led to one polling station having to be abandoned and relocated after the inside of the building became flooded.

The first voters to turn up to their local polling booth in Devon Way, Chessington, Surrey, were able to get inside to put a cross in their in/out box - but only after first wading through huge puddles.

However heavy rain persisted and the puddles eventually enveloped the inside of the building - forcing council bosses to relocate the polling booth to the nearby Hook Centre.

Kingston Council also shut the polling station at the Shiraz Mirza community hall in Malden Manor, telling voters to instead head to the Lawrence Avenue Children's Centre.

On the roads, floodwater led to delays on the M23 near junction 9 at Gatwick, the A24 near Morden and the M25 anti-clockwise near junction 11 at Chertsey.

On the M4 a car was reported to have spun off in the road in surface water between Windsor and Langley, while a crash between Witney and Burford left the A40 closed in both directions.

RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: 'We have seen a massive uplift in calls for help, with hundreds of extra breakdowns in London, Kent and East Anglia as motorists suffer the consequences of flash floods and the knock-on traffic delays.

'Alternative routes have become badly affected by the sheer volume of vehicles as drivers try to avoid the jams, and sadly this has led to yet more breakdowns.

'In the South West, the situation around Glastonbury continues to be a challenge and we are working to help those who have broken down en route to the festival.' 

The Blackwall Tunnel, which connects north and south London, was also closed over flooding fears. 

But fortunately for music fans at Glastonbury the storm just missed Worthy Farm in Somerset. 

After yesterday's heavy rain and traffic jams brought chaos to the first day of arrivals, thousands of festival-goers celebrated the end of the rain which had turned the site into a boggy mess.

However the festival could face additional chaos today as thousands more ticket-holders turn up at the isolated farm where it is held, causing huge hold-ups on the roads.

It has dealt with flooded homes, commercial properties and roads, as well as vehicles trapped by floodwater and properties struck by lightning.

There have been no reports of serious injuries.

In just one hour, 0.8in (20.5mm) of rain fell in Bexley, south-east London - close to half the June average - with some parts expected to see multiple showers bringing a month's worth of rain on Thursday morning.

A number of spots saw large amounts of rain overnight, with South Farnborough, Hampshire, recording almost 46mm (1.8in) between 7pm on Wednesday and 9am on Thursday.

Central London's St James's Park and Alice Holt Lodge, Hampshire, both received around 44mm (1.7in) overnight, while a number of other places in Surrey, Hampshire, London and Essex have had more than 30mm (1.2in).

It is understood cases have been disrupted at Snaresbrook Crown Court in north east London after heavy rain caused ceiling tiles to collapse inside some of the court rooms and corridors.

A source said: 'All of our hearings have been very much delayed in their progress. We are dealing with it as best we can. The surrounding roads are flooded and a juror has been stuck in traffic for four hours.'

Meanwhile, weather experts said there were more than 6,000 lightning strikes over the south east of England last night.  



In just one hour, 20.5mm of rain fell in Bexley, East London, close to half the June average, with some parts expected to see multiple showers bringing a month's rain on Thursday morning.

Rail passengers heading into London were left stranded on a train for more than two hours during this morning's rush hour commute after another train pushed a fallen tree into its path.

Commuters were left stuck on board after the fallen tree became tangled up in the train wheels - leaving it, and them, unable to move anywhere.

Passengers had to wait for engineers to be called out to free the stricken train before they could get going again.

The fallen tree led to the line between Wokingham and Bracknell, Berkshire, being blocked in both directions.

The blockage was on a busy commuter route between Reading, Berkshire, and London and had a knock-on effect for passengers waiting for trains at other stations. 



In Winnersh, Berkshire, some drivers were forced to re-route via Bracknell, around five miles away, after fallen power lines blocked roads and caused chaos on bus routes.

The Environment Agency has issued four flood warnings covering rivers in Bromley, Sidcup and Basildon, and 22 flood alerts across of the South East.

There are seven flood warnings covering rivers in London and Essex, and around 40 flood alerts across the South East.

A number of rivers in the region have hit their highest level on record over the past 24 hours.

These include the River Rom, the River Wandle, Beverley Brook at Wimbledon, the River Shuttle at Bexley, River Ravensbourne at Bromley and the River Ingrebourne near Rainham, Essex.   

An amber weather warning for rain has been issued by the Met Office for Hertfordshire, Essex and Thurrock on Thursday afternoon and evening, while a yellow warning covering the South East is in place until Friday.  

Forecaster Luke Miall said: 'If you draw a line from The Wash to the Isle of Portland everything east of that is in the firing line.

'A band of showers is coming across the English Channel and moving north-eastwards, that will bring some heavy downpours and localised surface flooding. There's going to be a bit of hail in there too, so there's quite a lot going on.

'If you're in the South East, you definitely need your umbrella and possibly a pair of Wellington boots.'  

Doug Wilson, Environment Agency flood risk manager, said: 'Torrential downpours across the South East, including London, could lead to further surface water flooding and significant disruption to travel on Thursday.'

He added: 'If travelling, we urge people not to drive through flood water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm (1ft) of flowing water is enough to float your car.'  





Roads in Battersea, south-west London, Barking in East London and Lewisham were under several inches of water.

Louise March tweeted that there was serious flooding in the Longbridge Road area of Barking and she was concerned over her property insurance.

She wrote: 'I saw a car under water people helping to push it out if the water never seen this in the 15 years I've lived here.'



Mother-of-two Jodie Rose, 37, from Barking, Essex, said flooding in her road following the heavy rain would hit voter turnout.

Mrs Rose, who is on maternity leave, said that the floodwater in her front and back gardens contained sewage and her children were unable to go to school as a result.

'We can't go outside into the garden, obviously, and the children are not at school today. It being polling day as well, I'm sure it's going to have a big effect on Barking voters.'

Mrs Rose, a teacher, said: 'My Nan is 89 years of age and she's already said that she won't be going out to vote.'

She said the water was knee-deep around her grandmother's house and that the pensioner would not take the 'risk' of going out to vote.

Kaysar said on Twitter: 'Blackwall tunnel flooded avoid. It happened at around 3am this morning.

'I entered tunnel and their [sic] was no turning back.'

Meanwhile, yet another car was left stranded under a railway bridge in Wallington, south east London.

The same bridge flooded earlier this month leaving father-of-four Graham Price stranded in a Mercedes E-Class.

A car became stuck underneath the railway bridge in 2.5 feet of flood water on Thursday morning and had to be retrieved by a rescue truck.

No one was trapped in the car, but firefighters cordoned off the road.

Richard Johnson, a member of the Worcester Park Residents' Association, said: 'After seeing these scenes several times in several weeks, I wonder how often this event will have to happen before it's recognised as something more than 'freak weather?''

Another yellow warning of rain for London and the South East of England was announced by the Met Office shortly before 11am on Thursday.



'The lady next door is disabled and she did say that she won't be going out if it doesn't subside,' Mrs Rose said. 'She said that she won't be able to get out if it doesn't subside a little bit.'

Mrs Rose, who has lived in Barking all her life, said she had never seen anything like it and that the flooding would make it difficult to reach the polling station.

'We're hoping it (the water) won't come inside my house but I feel sorry for my neighbours a few doors away - it's definitely in theirs already.'

In Surbiton, south west London, a manhole overflowed so much that it was spurting water in the rain.

Police officers filmed water bursting from beneath the metal cap, as 50mm of rain fell in just 60 minutes on Wednesday night.

Kingston police officers tweeted the 17-second clip with the caption: 'The flooding was so bad in Surbiton it created this dancing man hole cover.'

A number of thunderstorm videos were also posted by Twitter user @Yathiinn_LK, while Julian Gregory published footage on Instagram of a lightning bolt striking The Gherkin in central London and Gareth Watkins tweeted video of the bad weather hitting Clapham.

Couple lucky to survive after lightning causes a tree to 'explode' and sends part of it hurtling through a bedroom window just inches from their bed

A couple were inches away from death when a huge log smashed through their bedroom window after lightning caused a tree to 'explode'.

As storms battered southern England overnight, pieces of wood 'bigger than people' were sent flying through the air when a lightning bolt struck a 100ft tree in the early hours.

Josh Roles was in bed with his girlfriend Rhiannon Depla when a 4ft log crashed through their window landing inches away from their bed.

The 23-year-old, who works as an engine technician at McLaren, said: 'The lightning was getting closer and closer, one was really close then the next one hit the tree and our window just smashed and a log came through.

Lucky: Josh Roles was in bed with his girlfriend Rhiannon Depla (pictured) when a 4ft log crashed through their window landing inches away from their bed. Pieces of wood had been sent flying through the air when a lightning bolt struck a 100ft tree in the early hours

'We got straight out of bed and ran into the hallway. I thought lightning had hit our house, I didn't see the log. It was terrifying.'

The young couple called the fire brigade who arrived at around 1.40am to patch up the window but it wasn't until Thursday morning that they realised both of their cars had also been damaged.

Mr Roles said: 'It sounded like a bomb. It was so loud and with it smashing the window and the car alarms going off it was like a war zone.

'I think we are still coming to terms with it. It was frightening.
