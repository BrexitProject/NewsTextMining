Aussie dollar in turmoil as panicking traders send sterling to a 31-year-old low while $70b is wiped from Australian share market amid Brexit 'leave' vote 

2016-6-24

Britain's decision to leave the European Union has heavily impacted the Australian share market, with about $70 billion wiped from the ASX and financial markets around the world going into free fall.

The pound collapsed to a 31-year low and currency, equity and oil markets went into free fall on Friday, as early projections showed Britain would vote to leave the EU, reported Perth Now.  

After a closely-fought race, 48 per cent of the country voted to stay in the EU while 52 per cent voted to leave.

Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 sank almost four per cent on the news, falling 200.4 points, to 5,080.3 at about 3.45pm on Friday.

It managed to regain 123 points, or about $20 million, by the close of trade at 4pm, while the benchmark index now sits at its lowest point since April. 

The Australian dollar hit a two-month high early on Friday against the US dollar, reaching 76.06 US cents, up from 75.26 cents in late trading Thursday, on signs that the country would vote to 'remain'. 

But as news of gains for the 'leave' camp emerged, the Australian currency gave back all those gains and fell heavily against the US dollar to 73.83 cents in afternoon trading. 

Against the pound, the Australian dollar traded at around 54 pence.

Australian shares were also under pressure with the benchmark S&P ASX/200 index down 3.1 per cent at 5115.50- its lowest level in around two-and-a-half months.

The pound initially rallied to a 2016 high against the US dollar, to $US1.5033, when it looked as if the 'remain' camp would win the day as voting got underway.

But it fell dramatically after shock wins for the leave camp. Sterling lost a massive 10 per cent against the US dollar and plunged below $1.35. 

It hit a 31-year low against the dollar and analysts said one dive for sterling was the deepest since Black Wednesday in 1992 when the pound fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.

'The pound is plummeting as Sunderland votes heavily for Leave,' said ETX Capital's head of trading Joe Rundle.

'Markets are very nervy at the moment,' he said.

'The Sunderland result has definitely altered the tone of the evening and markets are getting very choppy.'

Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said despite financial market volatility over the Brexit vote, the way in which Britons vote 'doesn’t change anything that the Australian government has to do' in terms of the nation’s economic plans.

'Undoubtedly there is volatility in markets and currencies that sit around these events. But that is not necessarily determinative of long-term volatility,' Mr Morrison said. 

'The implications for Australia are minimal, potentially. But there are other decisions that may flow from this (from) which will arise different challenges.'

Fallout from the Brexit referendum reverberated through the global currency and stock markets on Friday.

The safe-haven Japanese yen rose sharply against the pound and trading in the export-heavy Japanese stock market was briefly halted.

'It's very jittery,' said Robert Rennie, senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney.

'We had the first results from Gibraltar which suggested a landslide and then Newcastle was only a marginal Remain and that was a disappointment.'

The last time Britain voted on whether they would stay part of the EU was 40 years ago.
