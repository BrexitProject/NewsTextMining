Get out now! Furious EU leader demands Britain makes quick exit from the EU as Prime Minister David Cameron resigns and global markets plummet over historic referendum vote to leave Europe

2016-6-24

Furious European Parliament President Martin Schulz has demanded the UK makes a quick exit from the EU following the shock result of Thursday's referendum. 

Schulz said the UK's relationship with the EU had been ambiguous, but was 'now clear' and a prolonged exit was 'the opposite of what we need'. He added that it was difficult to accept that 'a whole continent is taken hostage because of an internal fight in the Tory party'.

And the presidents of the EU's main institutions said in a statement today that they expect London to act on the decision to leave 'as soon as possible, however painful that process may be'.

EU Council President Donald Tusk, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Schulz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said 'any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty'.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who on Friday announced he will resign, had suggested that formal notification of Britain's departure might not come before October.

Cameron has suggested he would delay invoking Article 50 - which triggers formal exit from the EU - until his successor takes over in the fall. 

Britain has up to two years to negotiate an exit, but EU officials have been insisting on quick and potentially tough negotiations to discourage the 27 other countries in the bloc from wanting to leave. 

Eurosceptic parties across the continent are intensifying demands for their own referendums in the wake of the Brexit vote. Shortly after the result was announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National in France, called for a 'Frexit' vote on Twitter, while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'. 

In Italy, the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity. 

And there are also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden and Greece. Even if the union holds, the political earthquake that has erupted in Britain will have far-reaching aftershocks.

World markets were thrown into turmoil on Friday after the final vote was announced, prompting Cameron to try and reassure businesses across the globe that Britain's economy was fundamentally sound.

Cameron said he would stay on for three months and New York-born Boris Johnson, the former Mayor of London who led the 'leave' campaign, is the hot favorite to replace him.  

President Barack Obama said the UK and EU will remain 'indispensable partners' of the United States following the Brexit vote.

Obama said: 'The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security and economic policy.

'So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.

'The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.' 

David and Samantha Cameron comforted each other after he made his emotional statement outside the famous door of 10 Downing Street

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump arrived at the Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire, Scotland, with his family to officially open the revamped resort he bought in 2014.

He said the British people had 'taken back their country', adding: 'It's a fantastic thing.'

Later, when asked his opinion on Cameron quitting, Trump said: 'Well, that's too bad.'  

Trump posted a statement on Facebook promising close ties between the U.S. and UK if he becomes President, saying: 'A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.'





Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said in a statement: 'We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made. Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.





'We also have to make clear America's steadfast commitment to the special relationship with Britain and the transatlantic alliance with Europe. 

'This time of uncertainty only underscored the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.'

Her campaign has called Donald Trump's reaction to Britain's vote to leave 'dangerous and frightening'.

Trump, say her aides, reacted with 'pathological self-congratulations', a lack of understanding about the situation and a focus on his own businesses rather than the economic impact on American families.

Trump 'actively rooted' for the United Kingdom to leave the EU and is 'rooting for the economic turmoil in its wake', Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. 



Meanwhile, Trump dramatically said President Obama and Clinton pushed Britain into leaving the European Union - and predicted Americans will make a similar choice in November. 

He said the president - who in April lectured Britain that it must stay in and threatened it with dire economic consequences if it left - and his would-be Democratic successor had misread the mood of the free world. 

'She's always misread everything, if you think. She's misread this,' Trump told DailyMail.com of Clinton, during a press conference coinciding with the re-opening of a golf course in the west of Scotland. 

Both Obama and Clinton urged Britons to vote with the 'Remain' forces.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney moved to reassure panicking markets this morning after the pound nose-dived to its lowest level against the US dollar for 31 years.

Scottish Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon raised the prospect of a second independence referendum in Scotland within two years, potentially heralding the break-up of the UK, after 62 per cent of Scots voted to remain but were outvoted by the English.

Initial polls had the 'remain' camp winning by a knife-edge. But the final count saw a narrow victory for 'leave' as the nation split 52-48 in favor of becoming the first of the 28 EU member states to request an exit.

Stocks plunged in the U.S. and worldwide Friday. The result of the vote stunned investors, who reacted by rushing to the safety of gold and U.S. government bonds as they wondered what will come next for Britain, Europe and the global economy.

U.S. stocks gave up all their gains from earlier in the year. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 611.21 points, or 3.4 per cent, to 17,399.86. The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 76.02 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 2,037.70. 

Both indexes took their biggest loss since August. The Nasdaq composite suffered its biggest loss since mid-2011, down 202.06 points, or 4.1 per cent, to 4,707.98. Indexes in Europe and Asia took even larger losses.

Before Wall St had even opened, world stocks had seen more than $2 trillion wiped off their value amid falls of up to 10 per cent on stock markets around the world.







The pound fell dramatically, to $1.3638. At one point the British currency hit a 31-year low. 



Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 3.1 per cent. At one point it was 8 per cent lower. The German DAX index sank 6.8 per cent and France's CAC 40 index tumbled 8 per cent.

Japan's Nikkei 225 finished a wild day down 7.9 per cent, its biggest loss since the global financial crisis in 2008. South Korea's Kospi sank 3.1 per cent, its worst day in four years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 4.4 per cent and stocks in Shanghai, Taiwan, Sydney, Mumbai and Southeast Asian countries were sharply lower. 







Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said they were prepared to deal with the market volatility. 

Canadian-born Carney said the bank had 'engaged in extensive contingency planning' and he was in close contact with Chancellor of the Exchequer,

European Parliament President Schulz said the EU assembly would hold an emergency session on Tuesday and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that after 'the blow' of Britain voting to leave, the whole European project needed a rethink.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed 'great regret' at the result, but said the EU was 'strong enough' to 'find the right answers' to the vote.

Donald Trump arrived in Scotland on Friday morning just as the European referendum results were being announced. Trump (pictured, right with a bagpiper at Turnberry golf course) said it was a 'great thing' that British voters had 'taken their country back'

Pope Francis has said the British decision to leave the European Union reflects the will of its people and that Britain and the rest of the continent must now work to live together.

Francis told reporters en route to Armenia on Friday that the decision places 'a great responsibility on all of us to guarantee the well-being of the people of the United Kingdom'.

He said it also will require all to 'take responsibility for the well-being and coexistence of the entire European continent.'

The Vatican has supported the European project from its inception, seeing unification as a way to improve social and economic standards and solidarity. 

While officially taking a neutral position as Britain debated whether to leave, Francis' demands that Europe welcome in more migrants put him squarely at odds with the Brexit camp.

EU President Tusk, from Poland, said it was 'a historic moment but for sure not a moment for hysterical reactions'.

Tusk, who had earlier warned that Brexit could 'end Western political civilization', said on Friday: 'Today on behalf of the 27 leaders, I can say that we are determined to keep our unity as 27.'

Merkel, Tusk, French President Francois Hollande and Italy's Matteo Renzi are planning to meet in Berlin on Monday to discuss the next step. 

As results of the referendum poured in on Thursday night and in the early hours of Friday morning, a picture emerged of a sharply divided nation: Strong pro-EU votes in London and semi-autonomous Scotland were countered by sweeping anti-Establishment sentiment for an exit across the rest of England, from southern seaside towns to rust-belt former industrial powerhouses in the north. 



Speaking at a jubilant Leave.EU rally in central London, Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), said June 23 should go down in history as 'our independence day', and called for it to become a national Bank Holiday.

He said on Friday morning Britain needed a 'Brexit government'.    

A key factor in the vote was the migrant crisis which has hit Europe in the last few years, but many working class British voters also resented immigrants from EU countries such as Poland, Hungary and Romania who they feared were taking 'their' jobs. 

John Mann, one of the few Labour MPs to support the 'leave' campaign, said there had been a split between middle class voters who felt they benefited from EU membership and working class voters who felt the disadvantages - especially migration - outweighed the advantages. 



Mr Cameron, who called the referendum to placate the conservative anti-Europe wing of his party, backed the 'remain' campaign and was left with no option but to resign after the vote.

In an emotional resignation speech outside the prime minister's official residence, 10 Downing Street in London, he said: 'I held nothing back, I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone - not the future of any single politician including myself.

'But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.

'I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.' 

Choking back tears, Mr Cameron said he would not depart immediately and would seek to calm the markets over the coming 'weeks and months'.

But he said a new Prime Minister should be in place for the Conservative Party conference in October. Johnson, who stepped down last month as Mayor of London, will be the overwhelming favorite to take over.

Johnson's successor, and the first Muslim Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said today Britain 'can survive and prosper outside the European Union'.

He said: 'I want to send a clear message to the British people and to businesses and investors around the world this morning - there is no need to panic.'

Johnson started to set out his vision for a revitalized, outward looking country in a speech just hours after his long-time rival tearfully declared that he would stand aside.

The map shows a starkly divided Britain with Scotland, Northern Ireland and most of London voting to remain in the EU but most of England, and surprisingly Wales too, opting for the exit. Cities with large student populations, like Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter and Norwich, also voted for 'remain'

Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now 'highly likely' that there would be a second independence referendum north of the border, potentially within a matter of months

Johnson said Britain cannot and should not 'turn its back on Europe' and the Brexit vote was not a signal for the UK to 'pull up the drawbridge' and cut itself off from the continent.

He said the EU was a 'noble idea' for its time but was 'no longer right for this country'.

Johnson said Britain now had a 'glorious opportunity' to set its own laws, set its own immigration levels and 'take the wind out of the sails' of extremists who play on fears about immigration. 

He said: 'Yesterday the British people spoke up for democracy and I think we can be very proud of the result.'

Johnson also paid tribute to Cameron, who he described as a 'brave and principled' man and expressed sorrow at his decision to resign.



One of the repercussions of the vote will be in Scotland, which was out of kilter with England, having overwhelmingly voted to remain. 

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning said she would be pressing ahead with plans to stage a second Scottish independence referendum, which could be held within two years, as the Brexit vote was a 'material change'. 

She said: 'Scotland faces being taken out of the European Union against our will, which I consider democratically unacceptable.'   





Prominent Irish nationalist politician Martin Guinness also demanded a referendum on whether Northern Ireland should stay in the UK or unite with the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU.



McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, said: 'The British government now has no democratic mandate to represent the views of the North in any future negotiations with the European Union and I do believe that there is a democratic imperative for a 'border poll' to be held'.

McGuinness's party Sinn Fein was the political wing of the now-defunct Irish Republican Army and Brexit has raised fresh fears that the Good Friday Agreement, which ended 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland, could unravel. 

Last week, Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny raised the prospect of border controls being reimposed along the border between the Republic and the UK, in Northern Ireland, if British voters opted to pull out of the EU. 

The former prime minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean, Michael Misick, tweeted: '#turksandcaicos and other #British colonies should be given a #referendum to decide whether we would like to remain British.'

Some political analysts say the disaffected voters who opted for 'leave' were similar in many respect to those supporting a Donald Trump presidency. 

In an op-ed for the LA Times, London School of Economics fellow Brian Klaas and Marcel Dirsus, a lecturer at the University of Kiel in Germany, compared Brexit voters to 'Trump supporters sporting "Make America Great Again" hats' who 'believe they have lost too much for too long'.

'Their complaint is understandable. But turning inward will only make their problems worse and the world more dangerous. Britain narrowly succumbed to isolationist populism Thursday. Let's hope Americans don't make the same mistake by voting for a Trump presidency come November,' they wrote.   







The 28-nation trading bloc was created from the ashes of the Second World War to keep the peace in Europe.

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'As it defines the next chapter in its relationship with the EU, I know that the United Kingdom's position in Nato will remain unchanged.

'The U.K. will remain a strong and committed Nato ally, and will continue to play its leading role in our alliance,' he added. 

The first signs of trouble for the 'remain' campaign came as the first results came in from England's working-class northeast, which showed a smaller-than-expected 'remain' win in Newcastle and a bigger-than-expected 'leave' vote in nearby Sunderland.

The 'leave' side also outperformed expectations in other areas of England, and also in Wales.

The two areas which were solidly in favor of 'remain' were London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Nigel Farage looked somber as he conceded defeat at around 11pm, admitting that Remain may edge the victory, but he looked overjoyed after a series of results that were better than expected for the campaign at 12.30am

On Friday morning, Nigel Farage called for June 23 to be a national bank holiday called 'Independence Day'

He's a right-wing politician who is known for his outrageous statements, has been at the forefront of a campaign that has unexpectedly swept a nation - and even has a mop of blond hair.

No, not Donald Trump. Meet Boris Johnson, the American-born eccentric who is favorite to become Britain's next Prime Minister.

David Cameron announced his plans to resign as Prime Minister this morning after the UK voted to leave the European Union in an historic referendum.

Johnson -  known as BoJo, or just Boris, by the British public - is now odds-on to succeed Cameron after spearheading the Brexit campaign.

The Conservative Member of Parliament and former Mayor of London was born on Manhattan's Upper East Side.



He remained a joint U.S. citizen until last year, when he announced he was giving it up to show his commitment to Britain.



Johnson's family moved back to the UK just months after he was born and he grew up in Oxfordshire.

He went on to study at the prestigious Eton College, where David Cameron also studied, before the pair met as part of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford University.

The exclusive all-male dining society is known for its members drunkenly trashing restaurants before handing over money to pay for the damage.







Johnson studied classics at Oxford, where he became known as a joker because of his buffoon-like character.

Using bizarre, antiquated language, Johnson was known for babbling on - and has continued to use this technique to deflect tough questions as a politician.

He joined The Times newspaper in London after he graduated, but was sacked in disgrace just months later after he was caught out making up a quote.

Johnson went on to join the Daily Telegraph - who he still writes for - and rose through the ranks to become their Brussels correspondent, using his position to encourage Eurosceptic Conservative politicians to voice their distaste with the EU, splitting the party.

Some of his later columns for the Telegraph have been heavily criticized for being bigoted, including one in 2002 which called Africans 'piccaninnies' and talked of their 'watermelon smiles'.

He has also previously called gay men 'tank-topped bumboys' and on another occasion said: 'We don't want our children being taught some rubbish about homosexual marriage being the same as normal marriage.'

Another of Johnson's infamous gaffes saw him forced to apologize to the country of Papua New Guinea after saying the nation was known for 'cannibalism and chief-killing'.



With his tongue placed firmly in cheek, he said he would add the Pacific country to his 'global itinerary of apology'. 



Johnson was embroiled in further controversy when a recording emerged of Johnson agreeing to give a friend the address and phone number of another journalist who the friend wanted to attack.

Remarkably, Johnson did not lose his job at the Telegraph and just years later was beginning to forge his political career. 



He first stood for Parliament in 1997 but lost. However, he reignited his political ambitions and became an MP in the next election, in 2001.

Johnson became a senior shadow minister within the Conservative Party but was sacked after it emerged that he had been involved in a four-year affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt, who aborted their unborn lovechild. 

Boris is well-known for his salacious sex life. He married his first wife Allegra Mostyn-Owen in 1987 but split with her six years later.

Their rocky marriage came to an end after Johnson revealed he was sleeping with Marina Wheeler, who was already pregnant with his child by the time his wife found out.



Johnson married Wheeler the same year he finalized his divorce with Ms Mostyn-Owen, but that did not halt his philandering.

He denied the long-running affair with Ms Wyatt as an 'inverted pyramid of piffle', until it was proven and he was sacked.

Wheeler kicked him out of the family home but later took him back - and did the same thing again after Johnson fathered a child with another woman.



The existence of the child only became public knowledge in 2013 after an injunction was quashed. A judge ruled the public had the right to know about his 'reckless' behavior.



Johnson is now favorite to be Britain's next Prime Minister after leading the Brexit campaign to victory

Despite Johnson's scandalous personal life, the public's opinion would not be changed and in 2008 he was elected London Mayor. 



During his time as Mayor, his blond mop of hair was often seen whizzing through the British capital on one of the city's pay-to-use bicycles, which became known as 'Boris Bikes'.

He held onto the job until earlier this year, when he resigned to concentrate on being an MP and his not-so-secret ambition to become Prime Minister.

Johnson's seemingly untouchable public image is believed to be linked to his down-to-earth nature and his ability to entertain.

During the London Olympics in 2012, he got stuck on a zip-line and was left suspended in the air. The gaffe was something most politicians would never live down, but Johnson laughed it off.

He also flattened a Japanese child during a game of rugby last year and tripped over a boy while playing soccer.

His way with words has also enchanted the public, including on one occasion where he called local politicians in London 'great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies' after they failed to quiz him on his policies.

Johnson has also claimed voting for his party 'will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW'. 



The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples.

They have declared their independence from the European Union, and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.

A Trump Administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce, culture and mutual defense.

The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries – and our two peoples – are united together, as they will be under a Trump Administration.

Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence.

Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first.

They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.

I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again. 

As the polls closed Thursday, UKIP leader Farage set a downbeat tone for the supporters of a British exit — or Brexit — from the EU, telling Sky News television 'it looks like 'remain' will edge it' in the referendum, sending the pound to a 2016 peak of $1.50.

But he withdrew those comments later, telling reporters at a 'leave' party in central London 'maybe just under half, maybe just over half of the country' had voted to pull Britain out of the EU.

Pollster Ipsos MORI said a survey conducted on Wednesday and Thursday suggested the 'remain' side would win Britain's EU referendum by a margin of 54 per cent to 46 per cent.

But on Thursday the firm had released a poll that indicated a 52-48 victory for 'remain'.

That phone poll of 1,592 people had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. And it proved to be wrong by exactly that margin.



The overseas territory of Gibraltar, off the coast of southern Spain, was the first to report results late Thursday, and as expected the British enclave reported an overwhelming vote for 'remain' — 96 per cent.

There as elsewhere, turnout appeared high. 

Officials in the Rock of Gibraltar said almost 84 per cent of eligible voters turned out to cast ballots; witnesses and reporters elsewhere said turnout was higher than in last year's general election, which was 66 per cent.

On Friday, Spain seized on the result to call for co-sovereignty of Gibraltar. 

Spain's acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said: 'It's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time. 

'I hope the formula of co-sovereignty - to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock - is much closer than before.'

High turnout had been expected to boost the 'remain' vote, because 'leave' supporters are thought to be more motivated. But high turnout in working-class areas that typically have lower tallies also boosted the 'leave' vote.

That was certainly the case in Newcastle, a city which had been expected to deliver a resounding victory for 'remain', Instead, the pro-Europe side squeaked by with 50.7 per cent of the vote. In Sunderland, 61 per cent of voters chose 'leave,' a bigger-than expected margin.

Referendum workers verify the validity of ballots in Britain's overseas of territory of Gibraltar, where 96 per cent of voters opted for the UK to remain in the EU. Spain seized on the Brexit vote to call for co-sovereignty with Britain in Gibraltar 

This pro-EU campaigner in Northern Ireland checks his mobile phone for early results, which painted a grim picture for the overall result. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister later called for a referendum on Ulster joining the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU

Polls had for months suggested a close battle, although the past few days have seen some indication of momentum swinging toward the 'remain' side.  



At a referendum night party at the London School of Economics, Kevin Featherstone, the head of the European Institute, said the vote should serve as a wake-up call to politicians across the continent.

'Wider Europe has got to learn the lesson about how to re-engage with ordinary publics,' he said. 'We can see across Europe countries which have been... far bigger supporters of the European Union for a number of years starting to have serious doubts.'

But Peter Lundgren, an MEP from the far-right Sweden Democrat Party, told MailOnline: 'This is the beginning of the end for the EU. So many other countries will follow the UK. Europe will fall.' 

David Cameron delivering his resignation statement this morning

The country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise – perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people – from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar – have all had their say.

We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people with these big decisions.

We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed, there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves - and that is what we have done.

The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.

I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believed was the national interest.

And let me congratulate all those who took part in the leave campaign – for the spirited and passionate case that they made.

The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision.

So there can be no doubt about the result.

Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong.

And I would also reassure Brits living in European countries and European citizens living here that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.

We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Governments, to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.

But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.

I am very proud and very honoured to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years.

I believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history; with reforms to welfare and education; increasing people's life chances; building a bigger and stronger society; keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.

But above all restoring Britain's economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.

I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions – not duck them.

That's why we delivered the first Coalition government in seventy years to bring our economy back from the brink. It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.

I fought this campaign in the only way I know how – which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel – head, heart and soul.

I held nothing back.

I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician, including myself.

But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.

I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.

This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.

There is no need for a precise timetable today, but in my view we should aim to have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October.

Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months. The Cabinet will meet on Monday.

The Governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty the Queen this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking.

A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister, and I think it is right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.

I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision.

The British people have made a choice. That not only needs to be respected – but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.

Britain is a special country.

We have so many great advantages.

A parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate; a great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.

And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.

Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way.

Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way, and I will do everything I can to help.

I love this country – and I feel honoured to have served it.

And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.

Conservative leadership contests are fought in two parts - first the Tory MPs whittle down the contenders to just two before the Tory membership picks a winner.

The format has a habit of squeezing out contenders and in 2005 Liam Fox ran but never made it into the final round - contested in the end by David Cameron and David Davis.  



BORIS JOHNSON

The overwhelming favorite going into the contest, the former Mayor of London has led the Vote Leave campaign to an improbable victory. 

Declaring for Brexit in February cemented the Uxbridge MP as a darling of the Tory right and he seems certain to make the shortlist.

Johnson has a celebrity unique among British politicians but despite eight years running the capital, he will have a big job to do to persuade the country he is up to leading the country. 



GEORGE OSBORNE 

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has long been the heir-apparent to David Cameron.

The Prime Minister's deputy and close ally has spent six years in Number 11, is credited by many in the Tory Party for rescuing the economy and is a prized tactician.

But his leadership bid has almost certainly been crashed off the tracks by a catastrophic Budget in March and his role standing shoulder to shoulder with the PM during the referendum campaign. 



RUTH DAVIDSON 

The Leader of the Scottish Conservatives arrives at the contest having pulled off the near miracle of overhauling Labour to take second in Scotland.

Davidson was a star of the referendum campaign for her combative appearance at the final TV debate and as someone a million miles from the old Etonian Tory which has proven toxic with much of the electorate she would be prized by the One Nation wing of the party. 

Her candidacy is a longshot - not least because she is not an MP and has a huge job opposing Nicola Sturgeon in Holyrood. But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? 









THERESA MAY

After six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.

May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. 

Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.



STEPHEN CRABB

Perhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.

Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.

Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. 



LIAM FOX 

A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.

But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.

The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.

While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.  















Banking giants consider moving thousands of jobs out of Britain after Brexit vote as big businesses warn of a profits slum 

City rocked: Banking giant JP Morgan is reportedly considering moving staff from his London HQ to Paris after today's Brexit vote



Several of the world's biggest banks are already considering sending thousands of jobs out of Britain after today's Brexit win.

JP Morgan, the globe's biggest investment bank, and BNP Paribas, France's financial giant, are reportedly looking at whether they should now move their London bases to Paris.

But American giant Morgan Stanley has denied rumours that it is planning to move 2,000 investment banking jobs to Frankfurt and Dublin.

It came as British Airways owner IAG issued a profit warning following the UK's decision to leave the EU.

The company's share price tanked 19 per cent to 425.6p in trading on Friday morning.

City workers are braced for months of pain as banks and financial institutions begin the process of considering whether to slash jobs or relocate to Europe in the wake of Brexit.

HSBC and Goldman Sachs all said prior to the vote that thousands of jobs in the City of London could be moved to the continent in the event of Brexit.

Sarah Phillips, partner at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said the Brexit vote will have a 'big impact' on people working in Britain's financial services sector.

She added: 'Many banks, insurers and fund managers who have large businesses in continental Europe could consider relocating to Paris or Frankfurt and senior staff will either lose their roles or have to move to another country.

'Some global investment banks, such as JPMorgan, have said that Brexit would lead to a significant loss of jobs in the UK.'

HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver said in February that a vote to leave could see 5,000 London-based investment bankers move out of London to Paris.

Jamie Dimon, head of JP Morgan, said earlier this month that up to 4,000 jobs could be hit.

Although banks have been cautious on Friday in making any brash statements regarding their future plans, experts are forecasting that large scale redundancies could be on the cards.

Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde & Co, said: 'At a more fundamental level, unless the financial services passporting rules are resolved in the UK's favour, then many large financial services businesses are likely to relocate to within the EU - meaning large scale redundancies would be highly probable.'

Many banks and businesses joined the Remain campaign and warned of catastrophe have today looked to reassure instead.

Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has said the bank respects the decision of the British electorate, while HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said that 'we are today entering a new era for Britain and British business'. 

Virgin founder Richard Branson said today it 'a very sad decision that will do huge damage to Britain's prosperity and Europe's stability'.



Oil and gas experts Royal Dutch Shell said: 'Although Shell was in favor of the UK remaining in the EU, we respect the decision of the majority of the British people who voted to elect to leave.

'We will work with the UK government and European institutions on any implications for us. Our priority is to continue providing reliable, affordable energy to our customers in Europe and the UK.' 

Unsurprisingly, news that Britain has voted to leave the European Union has made the front pages of every major US newspaper.

The New York Times asked whether the European Union and the UK would now be able hold together.

The paper’s London-based reporter Steven Erlanger wrote: ‘Will Britain retreat to become a Little England, nationalist and a touch xenophobic, responding to the voters that drove it to quit the European Union?

‘Even more important: Will it even hold together? With Scotland deeply pro-European, pressure will increase for another independence referendum that could bring an end to the United Kingdom.’

He added: ‘Britain, a nation whose storied history has encompassed the birth of constitutional government, global empire, royal pageantry and heroic defense against fascism, is entering unknown territory. The questions about its new path could remain unresolved for years.’

The New York Daily News bluntly reported that ‘the Brits told the European Union to bugger off’, adding that the ‘hard-fought referendum’ was ‘seething with wide-reaching economic and political effects’.

The Los Angeles Times stated that ‘Britain is once again an island’, with the ‘historic vote’ something that ‘could profoundly reshape Europe’s economy’.

The heavyweight Washington Post explained that ‘British voters have defied the will of their leaders, foreign allies and much of the political establishment by opting to rupture the country’s primary connection to Europe in a stunning result that will radiate economic and political uncertainty across the globe'.

The Chicago Tribune described the referendum campaign as ‘bitterly divisive’ and stated that British politics was now in ‘disarray’.

It said: ‘Britain voted to leave the European Union after a bitterly divisive referendum campaign, sending global markets plunging Friday, casting British politics into disarray and shattering the stability of a project in continental unity designed half a century ago to prevent World War III.’

The New York Post struggled to marshal the facts, wrongly stating that it was England, and not the UK, that had left the EU.

It said: 'The seismic moves underscore how unprepared Wall Street and financial centers around the world were for England to leave the EU.'  









USA Today called the result a 'stunning rebuke'.

It said: 'In a stunning rebuke to the “European project” and their own political class, British voters defied opinion polls and market expectations and chose to leave theby a decisive margin.

'The result – the first time any member of the 28-nation EU has chosen to leave the union – will have repercussions for both Britain and the EU, and perhaps for the global economy, that are difficult to forecast.'
