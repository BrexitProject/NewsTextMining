2016-6-20

A 55-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly racist threats were made to a Muslim MEP on social media who was called a ‘mussie p****’ and a ‘f****** immigrant’.

Sajjad Karim, a Conservative MEP for North West England, said he fears for the safety of his wife and 13-year-old daughter after being sent the messages.

And the Lancashire-born MEP of 12 years is so concerned by increasing tensions in the European Union referendum campaign that he will no longer take part in debates.

The arrest of the man from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, came on Friday, just hours after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in Birstall, West Yorkshire.

British-Pakistani politician Mr Karim, 45, who is a Remain supporter, has accused senior Leave campaigners of stirring up hatred and called for tighter security for politicians who need it.

The suspect allegedly wrote an abusive message after watching a video of Ukip leader Nigel Farage criticising Mr Karim and saying: ‘I'm sure Mr Cameron will deal with him.’

Mr Farage recorded the video after Mr Karim commented on a BBC report which showed a teenage spectator challenging the Ukip leader.

Mr Karim tweeted: ‘He has been brave to face them by himself - thank goodness cameras [were] present otherwise I'm sure he would have been dealt with.’

While Ukip supporters took it as a threat to the party's leader, Mr Karim insisted he was in fact expressing concern about the teenager.



'Don't talk out of your a***': The MEP said he has received a barrage of hateful messages and threats online

The MEP said that after the exchange was shared by a website he received a barrage of hateful messages and threats.

One read: ‘Don't talk out of your a***, the only reason you want in is because you'll lose money... and threatening Mr Nigel Farage will get YOU enemies you p****... We know where to come if anything happens to him... I'll be the first to knock on your door you mussie [i.e. Muslim] p****.’

Another said: ‘Someone should deal with you ya f****** immigrant.’

Mr Karim said: ‘I worried for my safety immediately. We have had a situation in the past where we had quite a number, 30 or so, far-Right extremists turn up outside my home address carrying placards.

‘They made a video of the whole thing and put my address on the internet, encouraging others to do what they had done.

‘Our safety at that address was compromised and we no longer live there. So yes, the police are taking this very seriously indeed.'

He added: ‘We get social media posts all the time and there is lots of racism and people targeting me for my religion, but this is particularly bad. I have been in the UK now campaigning for the Remain side in the EU referendum for a number of weeks.

‘What I have been sensing, mainly around the North-West, is that a real tension has emerged during debates and campaigning events.

‘Leave campaigners are packing them up and not allowing debate to take place but just shutting people down.

‘I am hearing things like, “These immigrants, these foreigners are coming over here and taking our jobs,” which I haven't heard since the early eighties.’

He added: ‘This week, I turned to one of my team members and said, “I'm not doing any more debates”, as tensions are running so high.

‘I could feel that something bad was going to come out of it. And then of course we got the news about Jo Cox on Thursday.’

Mr Karim said the campaign has been ‘intentionally divisive’ and added that measures should be put in place to protect politicians who feel they need them.

He said: ‘Our elected politicians have always been accessible. However, there is a need to make sure that people in public office are getting the protection they need.

‘There needs to be a balance between the safety of the individual concerned and making sure that their relationships are not affected.’

Last week, Mr Karim told BBC North West Tonight that he had received threats.

He said: ‘Other than the type of conduct that I have had to face, there has been very direct threats made, which are now currently with the police, are being investigated and I anticipate that there are individuals who will be spoken to as a result of those threats.’

North Yorkshire Police said they are investigating the offensive messages.

A spokesman said: ‘A 55-year-old Harrogate man was arrested on Friday in connection with social media messages sent to an MEP. He has been released on bail pending further enquiries.’
