2016-6-17

Tweeted by MP Jo Cox less than 24 hours before she was killed in the street, this is the last picture of her - speaking to students in her constituency about the EU referendum.

The 41-year-old married politician, who was shot and stabbed yesterday outside her constituency advice surgery, spoke at Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, last Friday.

Remain campaigner Mrs Cox tweeted a photo shortly before 4pm on Wednesday of her visit to speak to students ahead of next Thursday’s referendum, saying there was 'lots of interest and great questions'.

A group of teenagers could be seen in a library as Mrs Cox spoke in front of a screen saying: 'What are immigrants and migrants? What's the difference?' She said they had an 'excellent' debate.

But only 21 hours after posting the tweet she was attacked in Birstall by a man alleged to have shouted ‘Britain first’, three months after another man was cautioned for sending her ‘malicious communications’.

A school spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The entire school community at Whitcliffe Mount are deeply shocked and saddened at the devastating loss of our wonderful MP and friend, Jo Cox.

‘In an all too brief career as MP Jo made a huge impact. As a regular visitor to Whitcliffe Mount, she was an inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to meet her.

‘Students and staff alike looked forward to her visits and a buzz would always spread throughout the school in anticipation. Many of our students have come to know Jo well and benefitted enormously from her vast experience.

‘As a proud “Yorkshire lass” and the first member of her family to go to university, Jo was determined to raise the aspirations of local youngsters and to instil in them a belief that there is no limit to what they can achieve.’

Last Thursday, the mother-of-two spoke to dozens of primary school children about citizenship, democracy and aspiration while they listened intently during an assembly at Batley Parish School.

Mrs Cox tweeted shortly before 11am on Tuesday: ‘Led the assembly at the wonderful Batley Parish School, we focused on good citizenship, democracy and aspiration.' 

Headmaster Phil Sunter told MailOnline this morning that the school’s thoughts are with her family, adding: ‘Jo was a friend of our school and we are shocked by these tragic events.

‘She spoke to the children just a week ago and was very engaging when talking to them about her role as an MP. Jo always listened and genuinely wanted to make a difference in people’s lives.’ 

The photo has since been retweeted more than 1,000 times, and was reposted by Mrs Cox’s fellow Yorkshire Labour MP Caroline Flint, who said Britain had lost a ‘good MP and loving mum’.

Responding to the photo, Twitter user Debs Woodhall-James from York said: ‘Hopefully Jo's beliefs and her inspirational talk will have impacted on these children to challenge for change.’ 



Appearance: Also on Tuesday, Mrs Cox posted a photo of her visit to Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy with its manager Tracy Smylie (left), 18-year-old frier Paige Ramsden (centre) and server Lindsay Broadley (right)

Working with the community: Mrs Cox tweeted another picture of her on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'Pleased to support Bringing Batley and Spen Together, for professionals and groups working hard for local people'

Others said she was a 'politician you didn't hear anything bad about' and a 'good constituency MP', while another said there were ‘not enough words to express how truly awful this is’.

Later on Tuesday, Mrs Cox posted a photo of her visit to Heckmondwike's Yorkshire Chippy, which claims to be Britain's first gluten-free-only fish and chip shop, and described their food as ‘delicious’.

Jad Choudhury, 31, founder and director of the shop, told MailOnline today that Mrs Cox had popped in last Thursday in what is believed to be her last visit to a business. 

Mr Choudhury said: ‘She came down because she's been part of the business from the planning - she really wanted to put Heckmondwike on the map.

‘We're the first ever gluten-free fish and chip shop in history. Before I even started the business I got in touch with her. She's really keen to support the business. We’ve only been going since March.

‘She came down last week to try our fish and chips. She was supposed to come back to us this week with her family to have fish and chips with her family. It's tragic.

‘She had a heart of gold. She was very friendly, very bubbly, she treated everyone equally, she had no ego. She took her time to speak to everyone here and she was just loyal.’

Mrs Cox tweeted another picture of her on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'Pleased to support Bringing Batley and Spen Together, for professionals and groups working hard for local people.'

Meanwhile Mrs Cox’s husband Brendan and two young children were also busy this week - taking part in a pro-EU flotilla on Wednesday against a River Thames protest by anti-EU fishermen.

Witnesses said Mrs Cox’s assailant kicked and stabbed her and then shot her several times, the final shot aimed at her head. The alleged gunman has been named locally as Tommy Mair, 52.

Yesterday hundreds of people, including Labour colleagues Yvette Cooper and Dan Jarvis, packed into Mrs Cox’s parish church to hear how she ‘gave her life for this community’.  

Cambridge graduate Mrs Cox was elected in Batley and Spen last year. Shortly after the attack her husband tweeted a picture of her next to the River Thames, where they lived on a houseboat.

Speaking: Mrs Cox at Whitcliffe Mount School in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday

‘The entire school community at Whitcliffe Mount are deeply shocked and saddened at the devastating loss of our wonderful MP and friend, Jo Cox.

‘In an all too brief career as MP Jo made a huge impact. As a regular visitor to Whitcliffe Mount, she was an inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to meet her.

‘Students and staff alike looked forward to her visits and a buzz would always spread throughout the school in anticipation. Many of our students have come to know Jo well and benefited enormously from her vast experience.

‘As a proud “Yorkshire lass” and the first member of her family to go to university, Jo was determined to raise the aspirations of local youngsters and to instil in them a belief that there is no limit to what they can achieve.’

‘Whether debating with Citizenship students, showing sociology students round Parliament or simply enjoying a chat over tea and cake at a coffee morning, all who met Jo were struck by her warmth, her caring nature and her passion.

‘Those qualities very quickly earned her the respect and admiration of us all and established her as an inspiration to so many of our students.

‘At this time of grief and sadness it is also right that we celebrate the enormous impact Jo made and the joy she brought to so many.

‘This morning, the whole school community stopped to reflect on the many happy memories we share of a warm, caring, generous woman who inspired us all to aim for the stars, hold firm to our beliefs and be compassionate to those less fortunate than ourselves.’
