Jo Cox's devastated colleagues break down in tears as Britain unites in grief for murdered MP - as it's revealed police assessed her security after she faced THREE-MONTH barrage of hate-mail 

2016-6-16

Britain united in grief for murdered MP Jo Cox this morning as it emerged the popular politician had been subjected to a barrage of hate mail in the three months prior to her brutal killing.

The mother-of-two was punched and kicked to the ground by her attacker before being shot three times – once in the head - with  an 'antique gun'  outside a West Yorkshire library yesterday afternoon.

The married 41-year-old, who was a rising Labour star and dedicated MP, died from the catastrophic injuries she sustained in the attack, after the killer ambushed her as she walked to her constituency surgery in Birstall near Leeds at about 1pm. 



Mrs Cox's friend and fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves broke down in tears as she and others visited the centre of Birstall this morning, where hundreds of flowers and cards have been laid by grieving locals.

Flags across Whitehall are flying at half-mast, while flags at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh are also lowered in tribute. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen had written privately to Mrs Cox's husband, Brendon.

It came as it emerged that police had been poised to step up security for Mrs Cox, who became an MP last year, as she had been harassed in a stream of abusive messages over the last three months.

Popular MP Jo Cox, 41, has tragically died after she was shot three times - once in the head - and stabbed repeatedly with a 'foot-long knife' by a man as she arrived for a constituency meeting in Birstall near Leeds yesterday. She leaves behind her husband and two children

Two hours after her death, Mrs Cox's heartbroken husband Brendan tweeted a photo of her standing by the houseboat they stayed on when they were in London. Just yesterday, he tweeted updates from the River Thames as he rode on a flotilla with their two young children

The Times reported today that additional security was being considered at her constituency surgery in Birstall, as well as her houseboat on the River Thames in London where she lives with her family.

A source said that Mrs Cox had 'thought little of' the harassing messages until the 'volume and frequency stepped up'. A man was cautioned over them, and police have confirmed this was not the same man who was arrested yesterday following the attack.

The newspaper suggested there was no known link between the messages she had received and yesterday's attack, but reported that her security had not been upgraded before she was targeted.

Detectives were last night questioning 52-year-old 'loner' Thomas Mair, amid fears he was motivated by Mrs Cox's political campaigning. It was claimed her attacker shouted 'Britain First' as he targeted the MP in broad daylight.

Dramatic pictures show a man being arrested just minutes after the attack in a nearby street.

There is unconfirmed evidence Mair supported far-Right causes and claims he had mental health problems and had been released recently from psychiatric care.

The MP was an outspoken supporter of the Remain campaign and had called for more refugees to be given a safe haven on our shores. Last night her husband, charity worker Brendan Cox, 37, said he would dedicate 'every moment' of the rest of his life to his wife's memory.

'Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people,' he said.

'She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn't have a creed, race or religion, it is poisonous.

'Jo would have no regrets about her life, she lived every day of it to the full.'

Two hours after her death, Mr Cox – with whom she has two young children, aged three and five - tweeted a photograph of her and urged people to 'fight against the hatred that killed her.'

In a moving statement, he said: '[This] is the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. More difficult, more painful, less joyful, less full of love. I and Jo's friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo.'

Her parents, Gordon and Jean Leadbeater, who live in the small village of Roberttown, West Yorkshire said the family were 'in shock'.  

Mrs Cox's killing has sent shockwaves across the country with MPs across the political spectrum paying warm tribute to her.

Elected to represent Batley and Spen last year, the Cambridge University graduate had already earned great respect for her work ethic and humanitarian campaigning.

David Cameron said the country has 'lost a great star' as the Leave and Remain camps suspended campaigning.

The murder took place outside Birstall Library in a busy shopping street just before 1pm. Mrs Cox was walking to a constituency surgery – advertised on posters inside the building – after attending a school assembly about three miles away.

Witnesses said a man in a baseball cap grabbed her, pulling her hair as he punched and kicked her to the ground. As bystanders attempted to intervene, he pulled out a large hunting knife and repeatedly stabbed the MP, also catching a 77-year-old man in the stomach as he tried to intervene.

He then pulled out what appeared to be an antique gun which he fired three times from just a few feet away, aiming the final shot at her head. Some witnesses claimed he looked 'full of range' as he shot her at close-range.

One man said the killer deliberately moved in to finish off the MP, firing a final shot to 'the head area' in a horrific attack that lasted up to 15 minutes.

Britain First, a far-right  party, has tonight distanced itself from the attack. The groups' leader Paul Golding (pictured) took to its official website to issue a video  condemning the 'heinous' attack

Eyewitnesses claim the gunman shouted 'Britain first' as he carried out the horrific attack on Mrs Cox.



However, Britain First - a British nationalist political party which campaigns against immigration, multiculturalism and Islam - has now distanced itself from the attack and denied any connection.

The group's leader, former British National Party councillor Paul Golding, claimed the attacker could have shouted 'It's time to put Britain first', as he dismissed eyewitness accounts as 'hearsay'.

The leader of the far right party said: 'She has been out campaigning to keep Britain in the EU and there are people in the area that are against it.

'I don't think it was one of our supporters. We stand in elections and organise protests - we don't encourage this kind of nonsense.

'She has a young family - an attack on a mum like that is disgraceful.

'Whether you agree with Labour, to have had that happen to her on the streets is shocking and an indictment of the state of this country.'

In a video message released following the announcement that Mrs Cox had died from her injuries, he added: 'This is a terrible day for our democracy, for our parliamentary system. Our MPs are the representatives of the people and they have been for over 400 years now.

'So this is a very dark day for our country and for our democracy. We do not know what was said. At the moment, it is pure hearsay.

'It's an attack on a mother, it's an attack on our parliamentary system. It's just a downright act of criminality on the streets of Yorkshire. That's what we believe, that's what we think.

'I hope the person who carried out this heinous crime gets what he deserves.'

Britain First also issued a statement denying any involvement, suggesting that the phrase 'could have been a slogan rather than a reference to our party'.

A spokesman said: 'Britain First obviously is not involved and would never encourage behaviour of this sort.' 



Britain First, which was founded in 2011 by Jim Downson, an anti-abortion campaigner linked to Ulster loyalist militants, is in favour of preserving what it deems 'traditional British culture'.

The movement first attracted attention by protesting outside homes of alleged Islamists. It has also been known to carry out 'Christian patrols' and 'invasions' of British mosques and is known for online activism.

It has contested elections to the House of Commons, the European Parliament and the mayoralty of London, but has not held any elected posts. 

The group is also against immigration - an issue which Mrs Cox has spoken positively about.  It has raised suspicions that her attacker was opposing her political views when he fatally shot her.

A 77-year-old have-a-go-hero passer-by who tried to save the MP was stabbed in the stomach. Doctors said last night that he was expected to make a full recovery.

Witness Clarke Rothwell, who runs a cafe near where the attack took place, said the attacker shouted 'Britain first' as he carried out the sickening attack.

He said: 'He was stabbing her with a foot-long knife multiple times while shouting 'Britain first, Britain first, Britain first'.

'Three times she was shot, the initial time which then she dropped to the floor, and two more times.

'The third time he got close proximity, he shot her round the head area.'

He added: 'In the meantime he was stabbing her as well, he was stabbing her with his knife.'

The 42-year-old said he had rushed to the scene after hearing a 'popping sound'. He said he turned around to find the gunman standing over her.

'He seemed to have what looked like an old gun, like a musket, in his hand and he shot her again in the middle,' he said.

'He then seemed to shoot a third time, towards her head or face. He was also stabbing at her with what looked like a hunting knife, about a foot long. He was stabbing her and waving the knife around.

'A man who I know... tried to get near but the man swung his knife around and caught him in the stomach. Blood started coming out.'

Mr Rothwell said his friend 'tried to grab him, wrestling with him,' but the killer lunged at the MP 'half a dozen times' with the knife.

He said the sound of the gunshots sparked pandemonium, with people 'screaming and running from the area'.

Mr Rothwell said he attempted to follow the attacker in his van and saw him dump his jacket on the ground, possibly in an attempt to change his appearance.

Another witness, Sam Watson, added: 'The man walked away calmly and nobody wanted to approach him.'

Local restaurant owner Hichem Ben Abdallah, 56, was in the cafe next door to the library when he heard screaming and went outside. He said he saw Mrs Cox lying on the ground between two parked cars.

The man suspected of killing Labour MP Jo Cox confessed to feeling ‘socially isolated and disconnected from society’ as a result of long-term mental illness, it emerged last night.

Detectives were last night questioning 52-year-old Thomas Mair, amid fears he was motivated by Mrs Cox’s political campaigning.

There is unconfirmed evidence Mair supported far-Right causes and claims he had mental health problems and had been released recently from psychiatric care.  

It was also revealed that he volunteered at a special school several times a week.

Friends said Mair had never shown any interest in politics or the EU referendum. 

The only possible clue to Mair’s political leanings yesterday was that his name and address appear on a list of former subscribers to an anti-ANC pro-white South African magazine. 

The newspaper, then known as the South African Patriot, rejected 'multi-cultural societies, expansionist Islam and third world tyrants', and supported 'imperial solidarity'. In 1987, it moved to the UK 'following the fall of civilized rule in South Africa'.





Finding solace through volunteer work as a gardener, he was regarded as a quiet but friendly loner by neighbours on the estate on a hill above the murder scene where he had lived since childhood.

Mair also regularly helped his mother Mary, 69, who last night told friends she feels responsible for what he is alleged to have done. ‘She’s blaming herself,’ one said. ‘I told her she can’t blame herself, she can’t be responsible for other people’s actions, but she is. She’s devastated.’ At home last night, Mrs Mair said: ‘I don’t understand it, I just don’t understand.’

Duane St Louis, age 41, the suspect’s half-brother, said Mair had 'never expressed any views about Britain, or politics or racist tendencies'.

He said: 'I’m mixed race and I’m his half-brother, we got on well. He never married. The only time I remember him having a girlfriend was as a young man, but a mate stole her off him. He said that put him off [women] for life.’

He added: ‘It feels like a dream that I want to wake up from. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a picture of him on the news in handcuffs.’

In 2010 the alleged gunman had spoken to a local newspaper of how volunteering at a park near his home on the Fieldhouse estate in Birstall had helped improve his mental health.

‘I can honestly say it has done me more good than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world,’ he told The Huddersfield Daily Examiner.

‘Many people who suffer from mental illness are socially isolated and disconnected from society, feelings of worthlessness are also common mainly caused by long-term unemployment. All these problems are alleviated by doing voluntary work.’

Mair also volunteered several times a week at a special school in Dewsbury. 











He said: 'I saw a man wrestling with a guy with a baseball cap, trying to restrain him, but he shrugged him off. All of a sudden he started shouting and he pulled a gun from his bag. It looked like an old shotgun, maybe with a shortened barrel, the size of a cucumber. Then he fired and three or four seconds later he fired again. Bang, bang.

'At the first shot everyone ran, but then the adrenaline kicked in and we went closer again.

'He then just calmly walked away down the street.'

Mr Abdallah said the killer looked like he was in a 'rage' as he pulled the trigger.

Describing the gun as looking 'handmade', he added: 'She was a standing-still target for him when he shot her.

'The man stepped back with the gun and fired it and then he fired a second shot.

'As he was firing he was looking down at the ground.

'She was sat on the floor and looked like she was on the beach, her hair was roughed up, her face and legs were bloody.' Mr Abdallah said the MP appeared to be unconscious.

It was earlier thought Mrs Cox had intervened in a fight between two men but it is now believed that her attacker was lying in wait. One witness said he believed the attacker was waiting for Mrs Cox outside the library where she was holding the surgery with her constituent members.

Car-wash worker Karman Kinder said he saw her lying on the ground as a woman standing beside her screamed: 'Oh Jo! Oh Jo!'

He said there was a man lying on the floor nearby who looked as if he had been injured.

Mr Kinder added that he saw the gunman rushing away seconds after the shots were fired.

'As I went up the road there was a guy on the other side, hurrying down the street. He looked old and had his face down and then I saw he was holding a gun in his hand,' he said.

'Other people were chasing him and he disappeared into a side street. It was terrifying.'

Aamir Tahir, of The Dry Clean Centre, said the gunman was heard shouting 'Britain first'.

He said: 'The lady I work with heard two loud bangs. I wish I was there because I would have tried to stop him.

'Apparently the guy who did it shouted 'Britain first' and if I had been there I would have tackled him.'

Graeme Howard, 38, who lives nearby, told the Guardian that he also heard the man shout 'Britain first' before the shooting and during the arrest.

He said: 'I heard the shot and I ran outside and saw some ladies from the cafe running out with towels. There was loads of screaming and shouting and the police officers showed up.

'He was shouting 'Britain first' when he was doing it and being arrested. He was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance.'

Britain First is the name of a far-Right group opposed to immigration, multiculturalism and the UK's membership of the EU. Its leader, former BNP councillor Paul Golding yesterday posted a video online saying the attack was 'disgusting' while the group said it was 'not involved and would never encourage behaviour of this sort'.

Passers-by immediately tended to the stricken MP and police and paramedics were on the scene within minutes.

Witnesses feared the worst as paramedics performed CPR on Mrs Cox for up to 15 minutes before she was airlifted to hospital.



As a manhunt was launched for the killer, local shops and a primary school just 50 yards away from the scene of the attack were immediately put on 'lockdown', with no one allowed in or out.

However, shortly afterwards, two police officers arrested the suspect.

He did not try to resist, and photographs showed him sprawled on the road with officers standing over him and what appeared to be trail of blood by his arm.

Later they recovered the gun and a bloody machete-style knife. A team of officers were searching his council home, less than one mile away, where he has lived virtually all his life.

Neighbours said Mair, a voracious reader, volunteer gardener and special needs helper, was a regular visitor to the library where Mrs Cox held her surgery.

They said the semi-detached council house had been his home since childhood and said he had lived there alone since his grandmother died about 20 years ago.

The house is one of a number of addresses being searched by police as part of the investigation into Ms Cox's death. 

David Pickles, a neighbour of Mair, said: 'He's just quiet. He kept himself to himself. He lived by himself. He's been on his own for about 20 years. I've never seen a lot of people visiting or anything like that.'

Fellow neighbour Katherine Cooke, 62, said Mair had walked past her house at 12.20pm yesterday. ‘He looked the same as he always does,’ she said. ‘The only difference was, he had a rucksack on.’

Mair regularly helped his mother bringing shopping to her Batley home and helping in the garden.

One neighbour said: ‘He doted on his mum, he was round here twice a week bringing her shopping and things. He was devoted to her.’ Another added: ‘He was a lovely lad. This is completely out of character.’ 



There is evidence Mair subscribed to a pro-white publication 'SA Patriot', an inflammatory tiny circulation magazine based in London. One online message group described him as 'one of the earliest subscribers and supporters' of the magazine.

But his brother Scott, 49, said Mair showed no strong political views. 'He has a history of mental illness, but he has had help,' he said.

The suspect's devastated mother, Mary, who also lives in Birstall, was being comforted by friends. One said: 'She's really upset about the children. She's blaming herself.'

Duane St Louis, 41, Mair's half-brother, said he had obsessive compulsive disorder. At his home in Dewsbury, he said: 'He'd clean himself with Brillo pads.'

Police investigating the killing of MP Jo Cox have confirmed they recovered weapons, 'including a firearm', from the crime scene. 

Conflicting reports have emerged over what type of gun was used in the attack, but it is believed to have been an antique weapon - and one witness described seeing an 'old gun, like a musket'. 



Hichem Ben Abdallah, 56, was in the cafe next door to the library when he heard screaming and went outside and found a man trying to fight off the attacker, named locally as Thomas Mair, as he wrestled Mrs Cox on the street. 

He reportedly drew a picture of the gun for Channel 4 News correspondent Michael Crick, which was later shared on Twitter. 

It shows what appears to be an old-fashioned gun, which he said was the 'size of an average cucumber'. 

Speaking after the attack, Mr Ben Abdallah said: 'There was a guy who was being very brave and another guy with a white baseball cap who he was trying to control and the man in the baseball cap suddenly pulled a gun from his bag.

'He was fighting with her and wrestling with her and then the gun went off and then she fell between two cars and I came and saw her bleeding on the floor.'



Gas engineer Witness Clarke Rothwell, 42, was outside the sandwich shop close to the library when he heard a 'popping sound'.  

'I looked round and there was a guy standing over a woman on the floor,' he said.

'He seemed to have what looked like an old gun, like a musket, in his hand and he shot her.'





Mrs Cox, lived with her husband and two young children on a houseboat on the Thames. Before winning her seat last May she worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah, and Lady Kinnock.

She has become the first woman MP ever to be murdered and the first MP to be killed since the murder of Conservative Ian Gow in a 1990 IRA bomb blast.

MPs warned they were in danger in a committee report last year which highlighted increasing complaints of obsessive stalkers. Several MPs complained they had been confronted by obsessives armed with knives and guns.

Last night, a vigil was held by colleagues outside Parliament and by friends and neighbours at Mrs Cox's Thames houseboat, where owners sounded their horns in a two-minute tribute to the MP.  



Candles were lit along the gangway down to the jetty and hundred of flowers and pictures were placed on the vessel she shared with her husband. 

Anne Wainwright chair of the Heritage Moorings said: 'We are a very tight community. We're all pulling together. It's just so awful.

'Lots of people came to lay flowers last night, tributes have come from all over the world, it was rally amazing.

'We burnt some of our horns out because we sounded them for two minutes straight.

'I spoke to Jo's husband Brendan last night and we've exchanged some messages.

'He's obviously in bits, I can't imagine what he's going through. And her parents as well, it's so terrible, we're in such shock.

'I'm not sure when her family are coming back but when Brendan comes back we'll talk about any further tributes as a community.

'It has been mentioned that her name might get put on a bench nearby, but we're not sure yet.

'Jo was such a lovely person, she was tiny but had so much energy. She loved her work so much she had to get back to work after being a full time mum.'

A book of condolence was also set up for residents. One tribute left read: 'You have left a world that is changed by your humanity and empathy for the plight of others.

'May your lasting legacy be one that remembers that joyful optimism and tireless work really does change the world. Rest in peace Jo.'

Another tribute read: 'From one mother to another may your joy live on through your children.'

It came as politicians up and down the country paid tribute to Mrs Cox, who was described as 'one of the brightest MPs'.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: 'Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament.

'In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for.'

Prime Minister David Cameron added: 'The death of Jo Cox is a tragedy. She was a committed and caring MP. My thoughts are with her husband Brendan and her two young children.'

Campaigning for the EU referendum by Britain Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave has now been suspended for the day after the attack.

Commenting on the attack, temporary Chief Constable Dee Collins said: 'Just before 1pm [yesterday] Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen, was attacked in Market Street, Birstall. I am now very sad to have to report that she has died as a result of her injuries. Before going into further detail, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to her family and friends at this tragic time.

'Jo was attacked by a man who inflicted serious and sadly ultimately fatal injuries. There was a subsequently an attack on a 77 year old man nearby who has sustained injuries that are non-life threatening. Shortly afterwards a man was arrested nearby by police officers. Weapons, including a firearm, have also been recovered.

'At 1.48pm Jo was pronounced dead by a doctor working with a paramedic crew who was treating her injuries. This is a very serious investigation with a large number of witnesses that are being spoken to by police at this time. There is a large and significant crime scene. There is a large police presence in the area. A full investigation is underway to establish the motive of this attack.

'There are specially trained officers with Jo's immediate family who are fully aware of what has taken place. And we would ask the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time. Additional officers are working with the local community this evening, in order to provide support and reassurance to our communities.

'Clearly as our inquiry is at a very early stage, and we have an individual under arrest, we are not in the position to discuss any motive at this time. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.'

She added: 'We are attending a number of scenes as part of this investigation and we will be looking very closely at what evidence we may or may not be able to recover.'

Cambridge graduate Mrs Cox was elected to the seat of Batley and Spen at the last general election in 2015, having previously worked in aid.

She is national chair of Labour Women's Network, and has worked for various charities including Oxfam, Save the Children and the NSPCC.

The mother of two young children, who is said to enjoy mountain-climbing, boating and running, worked for Oxfam between 2001 and 2009 in a variety of different roles - and it was while working for the charity that she met her husband and father of her children, Brendan.

As head of Oxfam's Brussels office she spearheaded Oxfam's campaign for trade reform. In 2005 she joined Oxfam GB as head of advocacy.

Paying tribute, the charity's Max Lawson said: 'Jo was a diminutive pocket rocket from the north. She was as a ball of energy, always smiling, full of new ideas, of idealism, of passion. She gave so much to Oxfam.

'She was an inspiring leader, really bringing the best out of all of us, always positive, always believing we could win, and always passionate for change.

'She was particularly brilliant at bringing huge energy to our campaigning around the desperate humanitarian crisis in Darfur.'

Oxfam GB's Chief Executive, Mark Goldring, added: 'Oxfam is proud of the role that Jo played in our work over a decade. Many of our colleagues remember her fondly. The rest of us followed her work with admiration. She never lost her passion for peace, justice and equality.

'Everyone is deeply shocked to hear the news. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Brendan and Jo's family at this difficult time.'

Mr Cox and the couple's children drove a boat down the Thames yesterday. with an unknown woman, opposing Nigel Farage's 'flotilla'

Brendan Cox and his two children were seen on the River Thames yesterday, with an unnamed woman, as they opposed Leave EU protest

Labour MP Mrs Cox has been campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU in recent weeks and is pictured handing out leaflets this month

Mrs Cox voted in April for the UK to accept 3,000 unaccompanied Syrian child refugees, saying that she 'would risk life and limb to get my two precious babies out of that hellhole'





Earlier this year MPs were given an 'enhanced' security package amid heightened fears about the threat of attacks.

The move by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) came after the Commons vote on bombing Syria saw protests outside MPs' constituency offices and homes. There have also been concerns that backbenchers could be a soft target for Islamic State extremists.

Details of the extra security measures were not published, but they are thought to include more funding for alarms, locks and CCTV in constituencies and homes. Police carry out assessments of what risk MPs face.

The watchdog authorised £77,234 of spending on additional security measures last year - more than double the sum in the previous 12 months.

 

Jo Cox worked for Oxfam before she entered parliament as MP for Batley and Spen at the general election last year.

A mother of two young children, she is married to Brendan Cox, a former adviser to Gordon Brown who has also been chief executive of Save the children.

The 41-year-old also worked closely with Mr Brown's wife Sarah on efforts to prevent mothers and babies dying needlessly in pregnancy.

Since entering the Commons, she has made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria issues, including calling for the UK to enforce a no-fly zone.

In 2015 she abstained in a vote on whether we should join airstrikes.

Ms Cox nominated Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader, but is regarded as a moderate within the party and is very popular among her fellow MPs.

Yesterday, it emerged that a 37-year-old man had been arrested following a death threat made to Labour MP Ben Bradshaw.

The arrest follows an alleged campaign of extreme right-wing racist and homophobic abuse aimed at Mr Bradshaw and his staff.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the man was held for questioning after a call was recorded at the Labour MP for Exeter’s office at Westminster. 



Scottish Secretary David Mundell revealed today that he had once received a death threat after MPs backed airstrikes against ISIS in Syria.

The minister said police had advised him of a 'credible' threat in the wake of a Commons vote in favour of the action in December 2015.

He said, however, that Mrs Cox would not have wanted politicians to 'pull up the shutter' and become less accessible to the public.

Speaking after a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow, he said: 'I didn’t make it public at the time, but immediately after the Syria vote I received what police regarded as a credible death threat.

'It’s very concerning, not just for yourself but for your family, your staff in particular.

'The police do offer very good guidance and support in relation to how to carry out your duties in the safest possible way.

'But, ultimately, accessibility is at the heart of politics and you can’t let those people who want to disrupt our political system win by refusing to be accessible to the public.

'I know Jo Cox would not have wanted us to pull the shutter up as a response to yesterday’s dreadful events.'

He criticised the 'vilification' politicians are subjected to, saying “we’ve come to accept abuse and name-calling as a matter of course'.

He continued: 'When people hear about Jo, they understand that she is the exact opposite of the stereotype, somebody who wasn’t in it for themselves, somebody who took huge personal sacrifices, having a young family, having to come to London, because she wanted to do better for her community and the wider world.'



Last night, Lord Porter, Chairman of the Local Government Association, offered his condolences to Mrs Cox's family and friends.

He said: 'On behalf of everyone in local government I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Jo Cox. Our thoughts are with them at this tragic time.'

Councillor Nick Forbes, Senior Vice Chair of the Local Government Association, added: 'On behalf of Labour Councillors I wish to express our deepest condolences to Jo's family. Jo was a committed campaigner and Labour politician who died carrying out her public service. We have all suffered a great loss.'

The close knit community of boat owners along the River Thames also paid a nautical tribute to their loving friend.

At 8pm, boats berthed in Wapping by Tower Bridge blasted their horns three times before a full two minute blast in memory of Mrs Cox.

As the horns rang out, some neighbours stood solemnly by their boats with tears in their eyes before five children, holding a single red rose approached the houseboat and threw them onto the deck.

Holding back tears Anne, the chairman of Hermitage Moorings where Mrs Cox lived with roughly 45 others, said: '[This] is the saddest day of this close community.

'We have lost a dear, dear friend in the most tragic and outrageous circumstances.

'We pay tribute to our amazing, wonderful and spirited member of this community.

'A beacon of hope who believed in love friendship and values that we all so much need at this time.

'The community will continue to be inspired by her relentless energy and commitment to all that is good.

'Our thoughts go to her husband Brendan and her two wonderful children.'

Before she reached the end of her speech, Anne burst into tears and turned away throwing her own red rose onto the houseboat.

A 'happy go lucky girl from Yorkshire': Jo Cox dedicated her life to helping the lives of people on the other side of the world but never forgot her local roots

By Matt Dathan

Jo Cox, 41, (pictured) used her short time as an MP to continue her career-long dedication to helping the plight of refugees and made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria-related issues

Jo Cox was among the rising stars in Parliament before she was shot dead on the streets of her Yorkshire constituency.

She used her short time as an MP to continue her career-long dedication to helping the plight of refugees and made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria-related issues.  

The married mother of two young children was about to celebrate her 42nd birthday next week and yesterday her young family enjoyed a day out at Westminster, pictured in a boat on the Thames during an EU campaign event.  

Mrs Cox was a slight figure but had a powerful voice and used it repeatedly in Parliament over the last year to make the passionate case for taking in more Syrian refugee children.

And it was a fitting outcome that the former aide worker, who had put herself in danger throughout war zones and the developing world, played a central role in persuading the Government to change its mind and agree to accept 3,000  Syrian children into Britain. 

In a memorable speech in April, she told MPs: 'Those children have been exposed to things no child should ever witness, and I know I would risk life and limb to get my two precious babies out of that hellhole.' 



Mrs Cox was born and raised in the West Yorkshire town of Heckmondwike and was elected as the local Batley and Spen MP at the General Election in May 2015, beating the Tories with a 6,051 majority. 

Born to Jean, a school secretary, and father, Gordon, who worked in a local toothpaste and hairspray factory, Cox was educated at Heckmondwike Grammar School and became the first person from her family to graduate from university. 

But before she arrived in Cambridge, she spent the summer working at her dad's factory, packing toothpaste while all her peers enjoyed a gap year. 

She recalled in an interview with the Yorkshire Post how she 'didn't really speak right or knew the right people' at university and admitted her experience at Cambridge 'really knocked me'. 



She read social and political studies at Cambridge University, which is where her passion of politics was born. 

'I just felt like I wasn't quite up to speed with everyone else,' she explained. 'I was a happy go lucky 18-year-old from Yorkshire going out in Leeds having a good time. 

'A lovely life and a lovely family. Then I was thrown into a Cambridge environment where I just didn't get it. It shook me. All my norms and everything I was used to didn't feel like they were right anymore.' 



She went on to work as an adviser for the Labour MP Joan Walley and Baroness, before embarking on a successful career as an aide worker. 



She was married to Brendan Cox, a former adviser to Gordon Brown who has also been chief executive of Save the children.

The 41-year-old also worked closely with Mr Brown's wife Sarah on efforts to prevent mothers and babies dying needlessly in pregnancy.

Since entering the Commons, she has made a name for herself by campaigning on Syria issues, including calling for the UK to enforce a no-fly zone.

In 2015 she abstained in a vote on whether we should join airstrikes.

Mrs Cox nominated Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader, but is regarded as a moderate within the party and is very popular among her fellow MPs.

Labour MPs join hundreds of mourners in moving church vigil to honour popular Mrs Cox who 'fizzed with life and crackled with energy'

Hundreds of mourners including Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Naz Shah tonight attended a special vigil to pay their respects to Mrs Cox who they said 'fizzed with life and crackled with energy'.

Mrs Cox was remembered by her constituents, friends and colleagues as they packed out St Peter's Church in Birstall to mourn their friend and peer.

More than 500 people attended the 40-minute ceremony, including Mrs Cox's fellow Yorkshire MPs Ms Cooper and Ms Shah, who sat silently next to each other.

Addressing the crowds, Bishop of Huddersfield Rev Jonathan Gibbs said: 'Jo grew up in this community, she loved this community and she served this community. And in the end - she gave her life for this community.'

Bradford West MP Naz Shah was in floods of tears as she shuffled into the church to comfort Mrs Cox's constituents before being seated at the front of the room alongside her peers.

Other MPs - Dan Jarvis, Mary Creagh and Caroline Flint - also attended, and linked arms as they left the church together in a defiant chain.

Opening the ceremony at 8pm, Bishop of Leeds Rev Nick Baines said: 'Welcome on this very sad occasion.

'We pray for Jo and her family and friends, mostly in silence, let's think of what brings us together and what we are responsible for.'

Sobs and sniffles could be heard around the room as the room fell silent to remember their 'loving and caring' MP.

After five minutes of absolute silence, a psalm was read to the large crowd of hundreds.

Speaking at the vigil, Rev Gibbs said: 'None of us could believe the news. The texts and messages came flooding through and we saw the news - and yet we still couldn't believe the news.

'We come tonight, overwhelmed by shock, and above all we are still numb and that is still part of our reaction for all of us, to Brendan, and to her children.

'We should be still tonight - but after a time of stillness we will need a time to talk. There will be anger, hurt and pain, and we need to learn how we deal with that in our own communities.

'We remember Jo as a wife and a mother and tonight we honour both of those. We hold her, we hold the family in our hearts and our pride.

'We pray that justice is done.'

Speaking about the turn out after the ceremony, Rev Gibbs said: 'I'm so pleased by the range of people who have come to pay their respects.

'Jo was hugely respected by the whole community and she had their whole affectionate respect.'

Speaking outside the church about her friend, Wakefield MP Mary Creagh said: 'Jo fizzed with life and crackled with energy.

'She not only cared a lot about family and family values, but also about the forgotten, and disposed of people, and atrocities across the world.

'It has been a very troubling day in our open democracy - but our thoughts are with Brendan and those motherless children.

'Tonight I want Jo to be remembered as warm, witty and principled MP.

'She is such a loss, not just to the Labour party and her constituents, but the entire country.'



'We have lost a great star': David Cameron leads tributes from a shattered Westminster to tragic Labour MP Jo Cox 

David Cameron tonight paid tribute to Mrs Cox and said she was a 'star' in Parliament who had 'huge compassion and a big heart' 

By Tim Sculthorpe 

David Cameron said Britain had lost a 'great star' as he led tributes from a shattered Westminster after the killing of Jo Cox.

The Prime Minister, who has cancelled his referendum campaigning, said it was 'tragic and dreadful news' and sent his thought's to Mrs Cox's husband Brendan.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke of his shock at the loss of a 'much loss colleague' who was a 'dedicated campaigner for social justice and peace'.

Politicians from across the political spectrum revealed their grief after news of Mrs Cox's death was confirmed shortly after 5pm.  

Mr Cameron said: 'This is absolutely tragic and dreadful news. My thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan, her two children, and their wider family.

'We have lost a great star. She was a great campaigning MP with huge compassion and a big heart and people are going to be very, very sad at what has happened. Dreadful, dreadful news.

'It's right we are suspending campaigning activity in this referendum and everyone's thought will be with Jo's family and with her constituents at this terrible time.'

Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: 'The whole of the Labour Party and Labour family - and indeed the whole country - will be in shock at the horrific murder of Jo Cox.

'Jo had a lifelong record of public service and a deep commitment to humanity. She worked both for Oxfam and the anti-slavery charity, the Freedom Fund, before she was elected last year as MP for Batley and Spen – where she was born and grew up.

'Jo was dedicated to getting us to live up to our promises to support the developing world and strengthen human rights – and she brought those values and principles with her when she became an MP.

'Jo died doing her public duty at the heart of our democracy, listening to and representing the people she was elected to serve. It is a profoundly important cause for us all.

'Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament.

'In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo's husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for.

'We send them our deepest condolences. We have lost a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for social justice and peace. But they have lost a wife and a mother, and our hearts go out to them.'

Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: 'The whole of the Labour movement is devastated at Jo's death. We have lost a colleague so young who had much more to contribute to public life. She was our future.

'It is hard to comprehend how a compassionate, principled and beautiful person can be taken away from us so cruelly. It's even more devastating because she was doing what she did best - serving her constituents.

'We grieve her loss. Our love and prayers are with Brendan and Jo's family.'

Commons speaker John Bercow said: 'I am absolutely devastated to learn the news about Jo Cox. 

'Jo was an outstanding Member of Parliament and a wonderful, kind, caring person who was liked and respected in all parts of the House.

'My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this harrowing time.'



Mr Cameron said the loss of Jo Cox was a 'tragedy' as he offered condolences to her family, including husband Brendan and their children

Theresa May said Mrs Cox was one of the 'brightest and most popular' MPs and the pain her family and friends are suffering is 'unimaginable'.

The Home Secretary added: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this terrible time.

'The full details of what happened outside Jo's constituency surgery in Birstall are not yet clear and until the facts have been fully established I will not comment further.

'It is entirely appropriate that all campaigning for the referendum has been suspended.

'All of us are united in our deep sadness at the loss of one of our brightest and most popular Westminster colleagues.'

Former Labour MP Joan Walley, in whose parliamentary office Mrs Cox had worked before becoming an MP herself, was being interviewed on BBC Radio 4's PM programme as news of her death came in.

A clearly distressed Ms Walley said: 'Nothing has prepared me to be in a situation where I'm live on BBC radio to pay tribute to a really, truly special and compassionate woman, who totally believed in public service, who totally believed in eradicating poverty, who totally wanted to see environmental improvements, with a young family and a whole life in politics in front of her.

'Words can't express what I feel because Jo's life and everything she believed in are so badly needed now.

'My thoughts and prayers are with her family and I just hope all Jo's many family, friends, admirers, whatever political side they are, will unite to think about her, to think about our parliamentary democracy and to think what we can do together to be true to the things she believed in.'

Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell told PM: 'My thoughts - as everyone across Parliament's will be - are with her husband Brendan and her two lovely little children, who used to come into Portcullis House to have tea with her during the week.

'It is an unspeakable and un-understandable event that has taken place, and Parliament and her constituents will be much the poorer for her passing.

'But it's her family and those two little children who we must be thinking about now.'

Labour MP Jess Phillips said: 'My heart is broken. She was amazing, a brave giant who stood against bullies.'

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'Deeply saddened by news of the death of Jo Cox.'

And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'I didn't know Jo Cox but by all accounts she was a brilliant young MP.

'And she was just doing her job. My heart breaks for her family.'









 

 

 



George Osborne tonight cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo Cox

George Osborne tonight cancelled a major address on the economy and referendum to pay an emotional tribute to Jo Cox.

He said all MPs had been rocked by the 'appalling, shattering news' of her death when it was confirmed by West Yorkshire Police shortly after 5pm.

But a week before a vote that will define his career, Mr Osborne said 'freedom, liberty and justice' would prevail over the 'hatred that killed her'.

The Chancellor welcomed the decision to suspend campaigning on the EU referendum with less than a week to polling day out of respect for the tragic events in Birstall.

Mr Osborne, speaking at the annual Mansion House dinner, said Mrs Cox had died 'serving her constituents, serving our democracy'.



And Mr Osborne reflected on how all MPs making themselves available to their constituents is 'one of the virtues of our Parliamentary democracy'.

He said: 'It's what makes the way we govern ourselves very different from many others.

'To be an effective representative, all of us who are MPs engage with their communities, talk to everyone and anyone, hold constituency surgeries and must be prepared to stand up and argue publicly for what we believe.

'Jo did all of these things.'

The Chancellor said the Batley and Spen MP had been 'liked and respected across the House' after making an immediate impact since her election last year.

He said shed changed attitudes and helped change Government policy despite being a new, backbench, opposition MP.

Mr Osborne said: 'She will never know how many lives she helped transform.

'Doing that job, she senselessly lost her own life.

'Not since Ian Gow lost his life to an IRA bomb twenty six years ago has an MP been murdered, but others since have faced attack, injury and intimidation.'

The Chancellor continued: ' We believe in Parliamentary democracy.

'MPs have the privilege of representing the views of those who voted for them and those who did not. We believe in tolerance.

'In the words of her husband, Brendan, Jo would have wanted us to unite against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn't have a creed, race or religion. It is poisonous.

'And we believe in freedom, liberty and justice.'

Mr Osborne said the day's 'horrible events' were an 'assault on all these values'.

But in a defiant conclusion, he said: 'But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed, prevail today and they will always prevail.

'For they are the values of Great Britain, our great democracy.'

How MPs' security was beefed up this year after they voiced fears about lack of protection

By James Tapsfield for MailOnline 

MPs were given extra protection this year after fears were raised about their safety

Security for MPs was beefed up earlier this year after fears were raised about a lack of protection from people with 'knives and guns'.

The expenses watchdog announced an 'enhanced' package for politicians outside the parliamentary estate in January after a survey carried out by the Commons authorities revealed extreme concern about their own safety and that of their staff.

Details of the extra measures were not published, but they are thought to include more funding for alarms, locks and CCTV in constituencies and homes. Police carry out individual assessments of what risk MPs face.

The watchdog had already more than doubled the amount of spending authorised on security away from the Commons to £77,234 last year.

The internal report prepared by House staff following interviews with MPs said: 'Security was raised as a key concern by many participants; this related both to their constituency offices and their accommodation in London and largely related to what expenses they could or could not claim under Ipsa rules ...

'It was felt that the limitations of the office allowance that could be claimed meant offices could often only be situated in out of town areas, or deprived areas of town, where rentals were below premium.

'This had potential implications for the security of staff, who were often women working alone or in pairs. Participants also stressed that security is important as staff can be at risk due to the number of constituents they deal with that have mental health issues.'

'Others raised concerns about safety in their London accommodation. Although there is a separate allowance for security measures in their constituency offices, most participants understood that they had to pay for security measures for their London home from the London accommodation budget, which because of the very high rental prices in London was very difficult to do.'

'A few MPs gave examples of incidents involving stalkers, and those with knives and guns, which although not just issues for women, were ones where some women felt they were more vulnerable.

'A few were aware that concerns could be reported to the Police or via the Sergeant at Arms; but others did not know this and referred to difficulties in getting advice and support.'

The document went on: 'Many women stressed that if they were travelling between Westminster and their London accommodation, or back to their constituencies when it was dark, they would prefer to take a taxi as they felt it was safer.

'They were concerned that this was not allowed under IPSA guidance unless it was past a specific hour, and that even then it was subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, which deterred many women from so doing.'

Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle carried out a review the security provision away from parliament last year, and at one point there was pressure for Ipsa to be stripped of responsibility for funding security away from parliament.

In a letter to politicians in January, chief executive Marcial Boo said the expenses watchdog had always 'taken seriously the need for MPs and their staff to besecure'.

Referring to high-profile protests against MPs over the vote on bombing Syria and concerns that backbenchers could be a soft target for IS extremists, he wrote: 'Recent events have led us, with the police and the House of Commons, to take stock of our arrangements to ensure that they are appropriate to changed circumstances.

'This letter announces enhancements to the security measures available to you and your staff.'

Ipsa has distributed - but not published - guidance prepared by the National Counter Terrorism Security Office and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure.

The brutal shooting and stabbing of Jo Cox is the first time a sitting MP has been killed in more than 20 years. 

In 1990, Eastbourne MP Ian Gow, a former private parliamentary secretary to Margaret Thatcher, was killed by an IRA car bomb at his Sussex home at the age of 53.

Before him, the MP for Enfield Southgate Sir Anthony Berry died in the IRA bombing of Brighton's Grand Hotel, where Mrs Thatcher was staying for the 1984 Conservative Party conference.

Eastbourne MP Ian Gow, left, MP for Enfield Southgate Sir Anthony Berry, centre, and Ulster Unionist Party MP Robert Bradford, right, were all killed while in office

The IRA also claimed the life of Ulster Unionist Party MP Robert Bradford, who was shot dead aged 40 while holding a constituency surgery in a Belfast community centre in 1981.

And the Irish National Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the murder of former Northern Ireland secretary Airey Neave, whose car was blown up as he drove out of the parliamentary car park at Westminster in 1979. In 1922, Field Marshall Sir Henry Hughes Wilson was killed in an IRA attack.  



A number of MPs have also been attacked while holding public surgeries.  



Former Labour Cabinet minister Stephen Timms was stabbed twice by a student who had booked an appointment to see him in east London in 2010. 

Stephen Timms, left, 60, was stabbed twice in 2010 in his constituency office by Roshonara Choudhry, right, who launched the attack in 'revenge' for Mr Timms voting in favour of the Iraq war

And in 2000, former Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones, now a peer, came under attack by a man wielding a samurai sword, with the politician's aide Andrew Pennington killed while trying to protect him. 

Roshonara Choudhry was jailed for life for stabbing East Ham MP Stephen Timms in his constituency surgery in May 2010.

In January 2000, deranged Robert Ashman attacked Baron Jones as he conducted a surgery in his Cheltenham constituency.

Ashman seriously injured Baron Jones and stabbed to death his aide Mr Pennington as he tried to protect him. Pennington, 39, tried to fight off the attacker with an electric fire.
