'The people have spoken up for democracy': Boris Johnson thanks voters for backing Brexit but insists we will be 'no less European' outside the EU

2016-6-24



Boris Johnson thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU today and sought to reassure young Remain voters by saying we will be no less European despite cutting ties with Brussels.

He insisted there was no need for 'haste' in the process of officially withdrawing from the EU as he appealed for calm and sought to reassure fears over economic and political uncertainty. 

After the EU referendum results delivered a shock win for Brexit in the early hours of this morning, Mr Johnson said the EU was 'a noble idea for its time' but was 'not longer right for this country'. 

Brussels was 'too remote, too opaque and not not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,' the former Mayor of London added as he hailed the 'glorious opportunity' that quitting the EU gave the UK. 



And he delivered a stirring pitch to be Prime Minister of a new 'great' Britain outside the EU following David Cameron's dramatic announcement earlier this morning that he will step down within three months.

Boris Johnson is driven away from his home in north London this morning and made the short trip to Westminster, where he gave a press conference with fellow Brexit campaigners to set out an outline of their plans for life outside the EU 

Mr Cameron will stay on as Prime Minister for three months to calm the markets and allow the Conservative party to elect a new leader. Mr Johnson is the overwhelming favourite to win the leadership election and subsequently become the next PM. 

The new leader is expected to be installed in Downing Street by the time of the Conservative party conference at the beginning of October. But whoever it is will have a very tough two years ahead of them as they lead negotiations to establish a new relationship with the EU. 

Making his first appearance in public after the historic four-point win for Leave in yesterday's referendum, a humbled Mr Johnson said all politicians 'should thank the British people because in a way they have been doing our job for us'.









'They hire us to deal with the hard questions and this year we gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all,' he added. 

Mr Johnson stood alongside his fellow Vote Leave leaders - the Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Justice Secretary Michael Gove to set out their vision for Britain outside the EU at a press conference in central London this morning.

'I believe we now have a glorious opportunity. We can pass our laws, set our taxes, entirely according to the needs of the UK economy,' he said. 

'We can control our own borders, in a way that is not discriminatory but fair, and balanced and take the wind out of the sales of the extremists and those who would play politics of immigration.

'Above all, we can find our voice in the world again. A voice that is commensurate with the fifth biggest economy on earth – powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world.

'And the most precious thing this country has given the continent is the idea of parliamentary democracy.

'This Thursday, yesterday, I believe the British people have spoken up for democracy. In Britain and across Europe.

'I think we can be very proud of the result.' 

Mr Johnson is likely to play a central role in negotiations with the EU from now on having spearheaded the campaign to leave the EU. 

Lord Feldman will leave Downing Street with David Cameron after announcing he was quitting as Tory chairman 

Conservative Party chairman Andrew Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street later this year.

David Cameron has asked Lord Feldman to stay on while the party elects a new leader, which is expected to take place before the autumn conference.

Lord Feldman, one of David Cameron's closest friends, has been embroiled in both the scandal over bullying within Tory ranks and the investigations into general election expense declarations. 

A Conservative spokeswoman said: 'Andrew Feldman always said that he would serve alongside the Prime Minister for as long as he was needed.

'The Prime Minister has asked him to stay as chairman of the Conservative Party whilst the leadership campaign takes place.

'He will ensure that the party conference is properly delivered in the autumn.

'Lord Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street.'

Lord Feldman was seen visiting Downing Street on Friday morning shortly before Mr Cameron announced his resignation.

But he echoed Mr Cameron this morning in stressing there was no need to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the formal process of officially quitting the EU.  

‘In voting to leave the EU it is vital to stress there is now no need for haste and, indeed, as the Prime minister has just said, nothing will change over the short term except that work will have to begin on how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.

‘As the prime minister has rightly said, there is no need to invoke article 50.’  

Mr Johnson finally emerged from his north London home this morning after a growing media scrum and members of the public gathered outside. 

But he said nothing as he walked straight to the waiting car for the short trip to Westminster, where he met with fellow Vote Leave campaigners before staging a press conference with Labour MP Gisela Stuart and Justice Secretary Michael Gove - both of whom played key roles in winning the referendum.  



Mr Johnson was booed and mobbed by members of the public who accompanied the media scrum outside his house in the Angel neighborhood of Islington, north London. 

One onlooker shouted 't***' and another labelled the former Mayor of London 'scum' as he appeared at his front door, flanked by several police officers who escorted him to a waiting car. 



As he was driven away through dozens of journalists and photographers, more members of the public joined in the heckling.

His car didn't get far before it was trapped once again - this time by a crowd of around 40 cyclists and onlookers blocking a junction.

His vehicle was halted for around five minutes and police officers, who had been guarding his home, were nowhere to be seen.

The crowd taunted him with shouts of 'where are you going, Boris?' and 'scum!' and hurled other profanities as his car was trapped in front of a green light, unable to move.

One man yelled: 'The pound is down, what do you say about that? Is it going to be all right, Boris? Is the UK going to be all right, Boris? Are we going to be all right, mate? Come on, man up.'

Although the crowds had Mr Johnson's car stuck in the road, they did not appear to approach it.

Officers eventually arrived at the junction around 200 metres from his house, where they had been controlling a media scrum and crowds of onlookers.

There were cries of 'shame' as the car, with tinted windows, was eventually freed and moved off.

Mr Johnson eventually arrived at Leave headquarters on the Embankment at around 10am but swept in through a back entrance, avoiding dozens of press reporters, photographers and video journalists who had been braced to expect his arrival at the front of the building.



This morning was an example of the type of media blitz that awaits Mr Johnson over the coming weeks and months. 

Mr Johnson made a notable and direct appeal to young voters, who overwhelmingly backed remaining in the EU in yesterday's referendum. 

He said their right and freedom to travel across Europe will not be hindered by Brexit and urged them to be optimistic about Britain's future out of the EU.  

But he has a tough task ahead of him to win over the youth vote, with initial forecasts suggesting three in four 18-24-year-olds voted for Remain in the referendum and more than half (56 per cent) of 25-49-year-olds backing the pro-EU option. 



Mr Johnson said: ‘I want to speak directly to the millions of people who did not vote for this outcome, especially young people, who may feel this decision in some way involves pulling up a draw bridge or any kind of isolationism.

‘I think the very opposite is true. We cannot turn our backs of Europe, we are part of Europe. Our children and our grandchildren will have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages, and cultures that make up our common European civilisation.’  



He also paid tribute to the outgoing Prime Minister and said he was 'sad' to learn he was stepping down.

Boris Johnson (pictured emerging from his north London home this morning) could become Prime Minister by October after David Cameron dramatically announced his resignation from Downing Street this morning

Scenes of mayhem met Boris Johnson as he finally emerged from his Islington home in north London this morning, with some members of the public heckling him as he went straight into a car 

Mr Johnson was one of 86 Tory MPs from both sides of the referendum campaign to send a letter to Mr Cameron last night urging him to stay on as PM whatever the result.

But the Tory leader - showing visible signs of emotion as he stood alongside his tearful wife Samantha outside 10 Downing Street early this morning - said it would not be right for him to be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU. 

Hailing his 10 and a half years at the helm of the party and six-years in Number 10, Mr Johnson said today: ‘I have known David Cameron for a very long time and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age.

‘A brave and principled man whose given superb leadership of his party and his country for many years – reforming our public services, delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservatism that rightly earned him the first majority government for decades.

‘It was his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on the EU for 43 years, the first time many of us have had the chance to vote explicitly on this question.' 



While he recovered from four months of hard-fought campaigning at his Islington with his wife Marina Wheeler this morning, a man played bagpipes outside, despite the early hour.

He flew back to London last night after attending his daughter's graduation at St Andrews University, Scotland, where he caused controversy by unveiling a Brexit banner during the ceremony. 

With just hours to go until polls closed, Mr Johnson overshadowed his 22-year-old Lara's big day by waving a 'last chance to vote' poster to the audience. 

It caused mayhem as other student defied the ex-London Mayor by marching up to collect her degree with a Remain poster of her own as voters went to the polls across the country.

Mr Johnson performed the stunt as he sat in the balcony of the Younger Hall alongside his wife Marina Wheeler QC. 

Lara Johnson was awarded a degree in Latin and Comparative Literature from the Scottish university. 

Her dad flew up to Scotland for the occasion, posing for selfies with excited students after four months of hard-fought campaigning to persuade voters to back Britain leaving the EU. 

Ali West said she could not pass up the opportunity to make the Remain case to Mr Johnson, insisting: 'Boris Johnson was in the audience at my graduation today, so naturally I had some thoughts.'  

A witness to Mr Johnson's final stunt of the referendum campaign at St Andrews today told the Daily Record: 'It was all done very much tongue in cheek. Both posters got a huge cheer and round of applause. 

'Boris wasn't telling people who to vote for, just for them to get out there and make the effort.'

Boris Johnson (pictured talking to passers-by in St Andrews, Scotland, alongside his QC wife Marina Wheeler in the flowery dress and his daughter Lara, to the right of him) unveiled a Brexit banner at his  daughter's graduation today with just hours to go until polls close in the historic EU referendum





BORIS JOHNSON

The overwhelming favorite going into the contest, the former Mayor of London has led the Vote Leave campaign to an improbable victory. 

Declaring for Brexit in February cemented the Uxbridge MP as a darling of the Tory right and he seems certain to make the shortlist.

Johnson has a celebrity unique among British politicians but despite eight years running the capital, he will have a big job to do to persuade the country he is up to leading the country. 



GEORGE OSBORNE 

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has long been the heir-apparent to David Cameron.

The Prime Minister's deputy and close ally has spent six years in Number 11, is credited by many in the Tory Party for rescuing the economy and is a prized tactician.

But his leadership bid has almost certainly been crashed off the tracks by a catastrophic Budget in March and his role standing shoulder to shoulder with the PM during the referendum campaign. 



RUTH DAVIDSON 

The Leader of the Scottish Conservatives arrives at the contest having pulled off the near miracle of overhauling Labour to take second in Scotland.

Davidson was a star of the referendum campaign for her combative appearance at the final TV debate and as someone a million miles from the old Etonian Tory which has proven toxic with much of the electorate she would be prized by the One Nation wing of the party. 

Her candidacy is a longshot - not least because she is not an MP and has a huge job opposing Nicola Sturgeon in Holyrood. But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? 









THERESA MAY

After six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.

May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. 

Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.



STEPHEN CRABB

Perhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.

Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.

Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. 



LIAM FOX 

A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.

But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.

The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.

While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.
