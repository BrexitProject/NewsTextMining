It all ends in tears: David Cameron stands down in the wake of historic Brexit vote with emotional resignation speech as rival Boris Johnson makes first pitch to take over 

2016-6-23

While the country reflects on one of the most seismic political events Britain has experienced in peacetime, David Cameron closes the day knowing his time as Prime Minister is set to come to a dramatic end. 

The sun sets on a day in politics which had begun with Mr Cameron flanked by his wife Samantha in Downing Street as both fought back tears and he spoke of how he had been 'proud' to serve as PM for the past six years.

Mr Cameron said it would not be right for him to be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU.

And as voters changed the course of history, one of those who reigned victorious was former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who set out his claim that Britain now had an opportunity to re-establish itself on the world stage - and consequently made a pitch to be Prime Minister of a new 'great' Britain outside the EU. 

Boris Johnson set out his vision for a revitalised, outward looking country in a speech just hours after his long-time rival tearfully declared that he would stand aside in the wake of the referendum Brexit vote.

But it immediately became clear that whoever is in Downing Street will face a struggle to hold the UK together - as SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned it was now 'highly likely' that a second ballot on independence will be held north of the border.

Embrace: After the Prime Minister said that the UK needed a new leader he clasped hands with his wife - who was too emotional to return his smile after the devastating Brexit defeat

Emotional: Mrs Cameron clearly had tears in her eyes as her husband resigned - Mr Cameron himself struggled to get through his speech

Boris Johnson stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed David Cameron today - but made a broad appeal to people stay calm and help forge a better future

The developments came after the Leave campaign stacked up 52 per cent of the votes - despite massive support for Remain in Scotland and major cities including London.



The Bank of England governor Mark Carney has attempted to reassure panicking markets this morning after the Pound nose-dived to its lowest level against the US dollar for 31 years, and the FTSE slumped by 8 per cent. The index closed just 2.7 per cent down, as it recovered. 



After his speech, Mr Cameron travelled to Buckingham Palace to discuss the results with the Queen. 

Boris Johnson thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU today and sought to reassure young Remain voters by saying we will be no less European despite cutting ties with Brussels.

He insisted there was no need for 'haste' in the process of officially withdrawing from the EU as he appealed for calm and sought to reassure fears over economic and political uncertainty.

After the EU referendum results delivered a shock win for Brexit in the early hours of this morning, Mr Johnson said the EU was 'a noble idea for its time' but was 'not longer right for this country'.

Brussels was 'too remote, too opaque and not not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve,' the former Mayor of London added as he hailed the 'glorious opportunity' that quitting the EU gave the UK. 



President Barack Obama said the UK  will remain an 'indispensable partner' of the United States following the Brexit vote in the referendum - even though he intervened in the campaign to say voting to leave would leave Britain at the 'back of the queue' for a trade deal.

Mr Obama said: 'The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision. The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom's membership in Nato remains a vital cornerstone of US foreign, security and economic policy.

'So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.

'The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world.'

The bombshell announcement came after possibly the most dramatic night Britain has experienced in peacetime. Among the biggest developments are:

Mr Johnson, who was booed and called a 'tw*t' by protesters as he left his home in central London this morning, started off his statement at the Vote Leave HQ in central London by paying tribute to his 'extraordinary' Tory colleague Mr Cameron.

The former London mayor stopped short of confirming that he would stand to succeed the PM - but made a pitch for people to help him forge a better future.

He also sought to soothe fears over the financial market panic that has greeted the historic result, stressing that nothing would change in the short term. 

'I want to begin by paying tribute to David Cameron who has spoken earlier form Downing Street. I know I speak for Michael when I say how sad I am he has decided to step down but obviously I respect that decision,' Mr Johnson said.

'I have known David Cameron for a very long time and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age.

'A brave and principled man whose given superb leadership of his party and his country for many years – reforming our public services, delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservatism that rightly earned him the first majority government for decades.'

David Cameron said he could not be the 'captain of the ship' while the UK negotiated its exit from the EU as he announced he would be resigning as Prime Minister and Tory leader

The FTSE 100 rallied today and closed just 2.7 per cent down after more than £100billion was wiped out by panicked traders when Brexit was confirmed.

The London stock market has returned to the levels of last week despite dropping by seven per cent - around 450 points - when it opened this morning.

The UK's banks were the hardest hit with RBS shares down 34 per cent, Lloyds down 28 per cent and Barclays down 30 per cent as the markets opened.  

London's top flight index had lost more than £100billion earlier in the session, while world markets descended into chaos as uncertainty spread across the globe.  

Within minutes Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said would inject up to £250billion into the economy to steady the ship and the FTSE moved gradually upwards.

By 4,30pm £45billion had been wiped off the value of the UK's biggest companies and roughly 280 points had been restored. 

Brexiters had predicted  a sharp devaluation of the pound at the FTSE 100 was inevitable if they won, but argued that this would be healthy and boost exports.

Defending the Tory policy of holding the referendum, Mr Johnson said: 'The rights of all of us to elect and remove the people who make the key decisions in their lives. I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can.

'They have decided it is time to vote to take back control.' 



Mr Johnson said: 'In voting to leave the EU it is vital to stress there is now no need for haste and, indeed, as the Prime minister has just said, nothing will change over the short term except that work will have to begin on how to give effect to the will of the people and to extricate this country from the supranational system.'

He also stressed that the PM had been 'right' to say he would not immediately trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the formal mechanism for leaving the EU.  

'To those who may be anxious, whether at home or abroad this does not mean the United Kingdom will be in any way less united. Nor, indeed, does it mean it will be any less European,' Mr Johnson said.

'I want to speak directly to the millions of people who did not vote for this outcome, especially young people, who may feel this decision in some way involves pulling up a draw bridge or any kind of isolationism.

'I think the very opposite is true. We cannot turn our backs of Europe, we are part of Europe. Our children and our grandchildren will have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages, and cultures that make up our common European civilisation.'

Mr Johnson said he believed the country now had a 'glorious opportunity'.  

'We can pass our laws, set our taxes, entirely according to the needs of the UK economy,' he said.

'We can control our own borders, in a way that is not discriminatory but fair, and balanced and take the wind out of the sales of the extremists and those who would play politics of immigration.

'Above all, we can find our voice in the world again. A voice that is commensurate with the fifth biggest economy on earth – powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world.

'And the most precious thing this country has given the continent is the idea of parliamentary democracy.' 

Choking back tears, Mr Cameron - who led the Tories to a shock majority in the general election barely a year ago - said he would not depart immediately and would seek to 'steady the ship' and calm the financial markets over the coming 'weeks and months'.

But he said a new Prime Minister should be in place for the Conservative Party conference at the beginning of October. 

'I held nothing back. I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the EU,' he said.

'And I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician including myself.

'But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.'

Emerging from Downing Street grim-faced and hand-in-hand with his wife, Mr Cameron stepped up to a government podium and said: 'I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.

'This is not a decision I have taken lightly but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.

'There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October.'

He added: 'Delivering stability will be important. And I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my cabinet for the next three months.'

Tony Blair said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world' as he also hit out at Jeremy Corbyn's Labour campaign today

Mr Cameron said he had spoken to the Queen this morning to alert her to his decision. He also said he would not be triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but would instead leave it to his successor.

'The negotiation with the EU will need to begin under a new Prime Minister and I think it is right this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger Article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU,' Mr Cameron said. 

'The British people have made a choice that not only needs to be respected but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.

'Britain is a special country, we have so many great advantages – a Parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate.

'A great trading nation with our science and arts, our engineering and creativity, respected the world over.'And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi racial, multi faith democracy where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest their talent allows.'

He went on: 'Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before Britain can survive outside the EU and indeed that we could find a way.

'Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way. I will do everything I can to help.

'I love this country, and I feel honoured to have served it and I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.'

No10 officials are said to have tried to persuade Mr Cameron to stay on beyond the party conference in October. Pro-Brexit MPs argued that, if the PM removed George Osborne as Chancellor, there would be no successful challenge to his position.

But one pro-Brexit minister accused Mr Cameron of pursuing a ‘scorched earth’ policy designed to wreck chances of making a success of withdrawal, adding: ‘He repeatedly said he would deliver the verdict of the British people, whatever it was, and instead he has decided to cut and run. Another minister said they did not think it was possible for Mr Cameron to cling on for so many months without appointing a team to negotiate new terms with the EU. Mr Johnson described the PM as ‘one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age’.

‘It was his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on the European Union for 43 years,’ he added. Former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said: ‘I think it’s very sad that David has decided he has to go. I think he made the right decision.’

Moments after Mr Cameron finished speaking, Mr Carney made a televised statement from the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street urging calm.

He said it was 'inevitable' there would be a period of 'uncertainty' in the wake of the Brexit vote, and admitted it would take 'some time' for the UK to forge new arrangements with the EU and the rest of the world.

But the governor - who previously warned that Brexit was the biggest domestic risk to the economy - insisted the Bank and the Treasury had been doing 'extensive emergency planning'.

'We are well prepared for this,' he said. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her 'great regret' after David Cameron's push for a Remain vote in the EU referendum failed. French President Francois Hollande said the UK's vote to leave the EU must act as a 'jolt' to the bloc to implement the 'profound change' needed to address its troubles

And as the repercussions of the political earthquake reverberate through the nation - indeed the continent - Whitehall may be facing questions as to why it did not listen to the people on immigration - a massive and integral part of the debate for many.

Much of the evidence suggests immigration was one of the main reasons why many leavers voted to quit - with the biggest punches dealt by voters in the Midlands, Eastern England, Lincolnshire and Humberside - in areas where Eastern European immigration has been a huge concern.

Lord Feldman will leave Downing Street with David Cameron after announcing he was quitting as Tory chairman 

Conservative Party chairman Andrew Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street later this year.

David Cameron has asked Lord Feldman to stay on while the party elects a new leader, which is expected to take place before the autumn conference.

Lord Feldman, one of David Cameron's closest friends, has been embroiled in both the scandal over bullying within Tory ranks and the investigations into general election expense declarations. 

A Conservative spokeswoman said: 'Andrew Feldman always said that he would serve alongside the Prime Minister for as long as he was needed.

'The Prime Minister has asked him to stay as chairman of the Conservative Party whilst the leadership campaign takes place.

'He will ensure that the party conference is properly delivered in the autumn.

'Lord Feldman will step down when the Prime Minister leaves Downing Street.'

Lord Feldman was seen visiting Downing Street on Friday morning shortly before Mr Cameron announced his resignation.

Meanwhile, enraged Labour MPs today called for Jeremy Corbyn to resign over his failure to prevent a Brexit vote in yesterday's historic EU referendum.

One Labour MP remarked today: 'He is toast' and called on the Shadow Cabinet to oust him immediately.

Calls for Mr Corbyn to follow the Prime Minister and fall on his sword have grown louder after as many as half of Labour voters abandoned the political mainstream to support the Leave campaign.

Grandee Dame Margaret Hodge has tabled a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and if he does not leave of his own accord, he faces a secret ballot of MPs to overthrow him.

Mr Corbyn has never had significant support among Labour MPs and would be likely to lose a secret vote.

The Labour leader has faced repeated accusations he ran a limp, half-hearted campaign for Remain hampered by his long-held Euroscepticism. 

Tony Blair said Brexit made him 'sad for our country, for Europe, for the world' as he hit out at Jeremy Corbyn's Labour campaign today.

The former Prime Minister, a strong EU supporter, said: 'There will be very big consequences and we need to think our way through those carefully. But there is no point in hiding it - for me this a very, very sad day.'

He blasted Labour's Remain campaign, saying Mr Corbyn and his followers had not set out the 'enormous consequences' of quitting the EU.

Asked if the party's leader should resign, Mr Blair said: 'I think there are much, much bigger questions for the Labour Party right now. We've got to consider what our purpose is, where we are going and what we are trying to do here.'



A joint statement issued by EU leaders today expressed 'regret' over the UK's decision. But they promised to respect the British people's decision and called for negotiations to be launched 'swiftly'.

French President François Hollande said he wanted the UK to start talks over its exit package negotiations 'as soon as possible', while German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her 'great regret'.

The EU's joint statement said: 'In a free and democratic process, the British people have expressed their wish to leave the European Union. We regret this decision but respect it.

'This is an unprecedented situation but we are united in our response. We will stand strong and uphold the EU's core values of promoting peace and the well-being of its peoples.

'The Union of 27 Member States will continue. The Union is the framework of our common political future.

'We are bound together by history, geography and common interests and will develop our cooperation on this basis.

'Together we will address our common challenges to generate growth, increase prosperity and ensure a safe and secure environment for our citizens. The institutions will play their full role in this endeavour.

'We now expect the United Kingdom government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty.'

Eurosceptic parties across the continent are intensifying demands for their own referendums in the wake of the Brexit vote, as the repercussions of the political earthquake gradually become clear.

Shortly after the result was announced, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the Front National in France, called for a 'Frexit' vote on Twitter, while the far-Right Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders called for a 'Nexit'.

In Italy the leader of the Italian anti-immigrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called the European Union 'a cage of crazies' that is killing jobs and citizen dignity.

And there are also fears that Brexit could also trigger a Czexit, a Swexit, and a Grexit in the Czech Republic, Sweden andGreece. Even if the union holds, the political earthquake that has erupted in Britain will have far-reaching aftershocks.

Conservative leadership contests are fought in two parts - first the Tory MPs whittle down the contenders to just two before the Tory membership picks a winner.

The format has a habit of squeezing out contenders and in 2005 Liam Fox ran but never made it into the final round - contested in the end by David Cameron and David Davis.  



BORIS JOHNSON

The overwhelming favorite going into the contest, the former Mayor of London has led the Vote Leave campaign to an improbable victory. 

Declaring for Brexit in February cemented the Uxbridge MP as a darling of the Tory right and he seems certain to make the shortlist.

Johnson has a celebrity unique among British politicians but despite eight years running the capital, he will have a big job to do to persuade the country he is up to leading the country. 



GEORGE OSBORNE 

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has long been the heir-apparent to David Cameron.

The Prime Minister's deputy and close ally has spent six years in Number 11, is credited by many in the Tory Party for rescuing the economy and is a prized tactician.

But his leadership bid has almost certainly been crashed off the tracks by a catastrophic Budget in March and his role standing shoulder to shoulder with the PM during the referendum campaign. 



RUTH DAVIDSON 

The Leader of the Scottish Conservatives arrives at the contest having pulled off the near miracle of overhauling Labour to take second in Scotland.

Davidson was a star of the referendum campaign for her combative appearance at the final TV debate and as someone a million miles from the old Etonian Tory which has proven toxic with much of the electorate she would be prized by the One Nation wing of the party. 

Her candidacy is a longshot - not least because she is not an MP and has a huge job opposing Nicola Sturgeon in Holyrood. But on the day Britain backed Brexit is anything impossible? 









THERESA MAY

After six years as Home Secretary, Theresa May is the sober, serious choice - and probably the strongest 'continuity candidate' who could succeed Cameron.

May has become the longest serving Home Secretary, thriving in a brief which has proved the graveyard for many a political career. 

Tough, a safe pair of hands and widely respected - if not always seen fondly - May could be the anti-Boris.



STEPHEN CRABB

Perhaps the biggest unknown in the race, the work and pensions secretary was parachuted into the top of front line politics as the replacement for Iain Duncan Smith after his bombshell resignation over the Budget.

Crabb, a Welsh son of a broken home, could be the leading One Nation candidate in the leadership race.

Being a new name - and one who was quiet in the referendum - could allow Crabb to define himself a unifying candidate. 



LIAM FOX 

A heavy weight with Cabinet experience, Fox has run for the leadership before - and lost.

But he is extremely popular on the right of the party and played a leading role in referendum campaign, appearing with different parts of the Leave movement.

The former defence secretary is known to have a war chest ready and waiting for the leadership campaign and is well connected on the Tory benches.

While it is perhaps hard to see a route onto the final shortlist, Fox would undoubtedly be well organised and a fearsome candidate.  













Britons are 'chippy, ungrateful to Eastern European immigrants, economically illiterate and sad': Luvvies react to Brexit

Richard Bacon today blasted people who backed Brexit as 'chippy, inward looking and ungrateful to Eastern European immigrants' as stars had their say on the referendum result.

The broadcaster also said that those who voted to leave the EU were also 'economically illiterate' in a series of barbed tweets.

Harry Potter creator JK Rowling even said she wished for the magic from her books to go back and change the decision.

The author, who lives in Scotland, wrote: 'I don't think I've ever wanted magic more', adding: 'Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen'.

Scathing: Richard Bacon said today that a Brexit is 'inward looking', 'chippy', and 'ungrateful to Eastern Europeans' and JK Rowling said it will lead to the break-up of the UK 

Stinging: This is Richard Bacon's reaction to the EU referendum vote and said that it was 'economically illiterate' and 'sad' 

Upset: Harry Potter author JK Rowling called for magic to reverse the decision that shook British establishment

Blame game: David Cameron was accused of breaking up two Unions without ever needed to do so 

Other stars also rushed to criticise the decision to leave.

James Corden wrote: 'I can't get my head around what's happening in Britain. I'm so sorry to the youth of Britain. I fear you've been let down today'.

In a play on words BBC star Gary Lineker tweeted: 'U kip for a couple of hours and look what happens. What have we gone and done?'

He added later: 'We should maybe change the "Union Jack" to "I'm alright Jack".' 

Model Alexa Chung tweeted a broken heart emoji while Boy George wrote: 'There's no use crying over spilt milk. We'll just ave (sic) to mek (sic) the best of it!'. 

Another star to speak out was Niall Horan of boy band One Direction - who was not previously known for his political activism.

The 22-year-old singer, who is from Ireland but has been based in Britain since he appeared on The X Factor in 2010, singled out Nigel Farage for criticism as he expressed his upset at the result.

'It's a sad day,' Horan wrote on Twitter. 'The economic impact that this is going to have is definitely going to make those voters regret their decision.

'And I see Farage is talking c**p and telling lies as per usual on telly. Let's see what he does now. He really is a terrible man.

'How can you sway that many people into thinking their health service is going to be funded and when the vote goes your way tell them we shouldn't have said that and it was a mistake? Bulls***.' 



Messages: James Corden said the youth of Britain has been let down - Gary Lineker cited the influence if Ukip and said: 'What have we gone and done?' 





 

Sentiment: Model Alexa Chung tweeted a simple heartbroken emoji as she joined the long queue of stars to tweet  

Singer Lily Allen also took to Twitter to vent her fury and desperation at the result of the Brexit vote.

She posted: 'Well Millennials. We're really f*****.' 

While some celebrities tweeted their despair at the notion of a Brexit, comedians made light of the situation with Ricky Gervais, Hugh Laurie and Frankie Boyle all cracking wise.

Remarking on the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, Gervais wrote: 'Relax. Boris Johnson is going to take over now.'

While Laurie focused on the effect the Brexit will have on Britons attending Euro 2016, by writing: 'First hairline crack in the plasterwork: England fans will be paying 25 quid for a bottle of beer by Monday.'

Scottish stand-up Boyle joked that Britons should look for a new home, he said: 'It's important to accept the result and move on, possibly to a new country.'



Rant: One Direction star Niall Horan vented his fury about the Leave campaign on Twitter earlier today



Monthy Python legend Eric Idle remained deadpan and suggested that British Leave voters had made a rod for their own backs.



He simply posted: 'UK. Foot. Shot.'

Millionaire businessman and Apprentice boss Alan Sugar also tweeted his concern about the Brexit.

In particular Lord Sugar spoke of  the financial effects that the country's exit from the EU could have, he wrote: 'I just woke to hear we are out of the EU. Shocked to say the least. I fear for the future. Markets collapsed lets hope temporary.'

Artists, actors and musicians including Benedict Cumberbatch and Helena Bonham Carter  signed a 'luvvies' letter' claiming leaving the EU would make Britain ‘less imaginative’. 



The warning was signed by 250 of Britain's celebrities and says if Britain were to leave the European Union it would become ‘an outsider shouting from the wings’.







Gallows humour: Comedians took to Twitter to share their views on the Brexit, with standup Frankie Boyle announcing that it may be time to leave the country

Among other signatories were the singer Paloma Faith, 50 Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Wood, Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, 12 Years a Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor and The Wire actor Dominic West.

Tracey Emin, Steve Coogan, Sir Patrick Stewart, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, Keira Knightley, Jude Law, Eddie Izzard, Bill Nighy, Jenny Agutter and Jessie Ware have also signed.

These so-called 'cultural stars' also warned a Brexit vote could undermine the creative arts, pointing out many of them worked on projects supported by EU money.

Brexit would also undermine ‘collaborating across borders’ they said in a letter to the Guardian before the vote.

'From the smallest gallery to the biggest blockbuster, many of us have worked on projects that would never have happened without vital EU funding or by collaborating across borders,' the letter says.

Concern: Lord Alan Sugar tweeted that he was worried about what the future could hold after a Brexit

'Britain is not just stronger in Europe, it is more imaginative and more creative, and our global creative success would be severely weakened by walking away.

'From the Bard to Bowie, British creativity inspires and influences the rest of the world,' it says.

'We believe that being part of the EU bolsters Britain's leading role on the world stage.'

'And what would 'out' really mean? Leaving Europe would be a leap into the unknown for millions of people across the UK who work in the creative industries, and for the millions more at home and abroad who benefit from the growth and vibrancy of Britain's cultural sector.'

The letter was organised by Britain Stronger in Europe, the official campaign to persuade voters to remain in the EU.

The First Minister revealed  a second vote in just two years on whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom in now 'highly likely' after Britain voted to quit the EU.

Two thirds of Scottish voters backed staying in the EU yesterday - but because of a huge revolt in Middle England and Wales the UK decided to cuts its ties with Brussels. 

Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government will begin to prepare the legislation required to enable a second independence referendum to take place and said it was 'inconceivable' the UK Government could stop it. 

She said: 'There is no doubt circumstances since 2014 have changed. The option of a second referendum must be on the table and it is on the table'.

Her intervention has also led to calls by Sinn Fein for a vote on Irish unity because Northern Ireland also backed Remain.



'It's on the table': Nicola Sturgeon (pictured today) has said she will start work immediately to pave the way for a second Scottish independence referendum 

All 32 local authorities in Scotland delivered a vote for Remain - Nicola Sturgeon this shows that her country was being pulled out against its will 

While the UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, Scots overwhelmingly opted to remain, with Ms Sturgeon declaring the result meant there had been a 'significant and material change in the circumstances in which Scotland voted against independence' in 2014.

She said: 'As things stand, Scotland faces the prospect of being taken out of the EU against our will. I regard that as democratically unacceptable.'

Speaking at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, she said: 'I intend to take all possible steps and explore all possible options to give effect to how people in Scotland voted - in other words to secure our continuing place in the EU, and in the single market in particular.'

The SNP manifesto for May's Holyrood elections said the Scottish Parliament 'should have the right to hold another referendum if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will'.

Ms Sturgeon said: 'It is, therefore, a statement of the obvious that a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.'

All 32 local authority areas north of the border returned a majority for Remain in the EU referendum, with the country voting by 62% to 38% in favour of Remain.

Ms Sturgeon said: 'Unfortunately, of course, yesterday's result in Scotland was not echoed across the whole of the United Kingdom. The UK-wide vote to leave the EU is one that I deeply regret.

'The vote across England and Wales was a rejection of the EU and it was a sign of divergence between Scotland and large parts of the rest of the UK and how we see our place in the rest of the world.'

Furious Scottish nationalists had already pounced on today's historic vote to leave the EU by immediately demanding a second referendum on splitting from the UK. 

The SNP said the UK faces a 'constitutional crisis' after Scotland voted overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU but is on course to cut ties with Brussels after the Leave won the overall UK vote.  

All 32 authorities north of the border delivered majority wins for Remain and joined only London and Northern Ireland as areas that did not vote for Brexit. 

Irish republicans have already used the referendum result to call for the reunification of Ireland.

Almost two thirds - 62 per cent - of Scots who voted had backed staying part of the EU, with 38 per cent opting for Brexit. 

After counting had finished in the early hours of this morning, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland had delivered an 'unequivocal' vote to stay in Europe and said it was 'clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union'. 

It suggests she is already planning a second independence referendum after the SNP manifesto for the Scottish elections last month said they would demand another vote if there is 'significant and material' change in circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will. 

The passionate pro-union Harry Potter author JK Rowling angrily hit out at David Cameron, accusing him of putting the future of the UK in jeopardy for calling the referendum in the first place.

She wrote: 'Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen.'

This morning Ms Sturgeon's predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond  said he was 'quite certain' Ms Sturgeon would 'implement the manifesto' because England is 'dragging us out the EU'.

He said a second referendum on splitting from the UK should be held within two years so Scotland is not forced out of the EU. 

The process of withdrawing from Brussels will take up to two years from when the UK Government triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty - which sets out the formal arrangements for leaving. 

'From when that starting gun is fired, it's a two-year period,' Mr Salmond said of the withdrawal process. 

Insisting a second independence referendum was justified, he added: 'So whatever that period is - two years, two-and-a-half years, that would have to be the timescale of the next referendum because what you would want to do is remain in the European Union while the rest of the UK moved out.' 

Holyrood External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hylsop warned that a decision by the UK to quit Europe would have 'consequences'.

She told the BBC: 'Scotland clearly and decisively voted to remain part of the European Union, 62 to 38 with an increased turn out form the Scottish Parliament elections barely six weeks ago.

'That sends a strong message, it's quite clear we see a different type of politics in Scotland, a different approach to constitutional affairs.' 

'I think people will be looking very closely at this result and looking at the prospects for Scotland and what is in the best interests of Scotland going forward.

'We're quite clear, the Scottish Government will protect Scotland's interests whatever the circumstances and we intend to do that.'







How the Scottish Government will do that 'will depend on exactly what the result is', Ms Hyslop added.

'But we're very clear, the Scottish people have spoken. Their interests are about maintaining that membership, they are interested in maintaining our relations with Europe. We have to find the means with which we can do that.'

While she said there is 'some way to go in determining the mechanism of doing that', she said: 'Decisions have consequences and if the United Kingdom has made a decision against the interests of the Scottish people that will have consequences.' 





After all the results north of the border were declared, Ms Sturgeon said: 'Scotland has delivered a strong, unequivocal vote to remain in the EU, and I welcome that endorsement of our European status.

'And while the overall result remains to be declared, the vote here makes clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union.'

She added: 'Scotland has contributed significantly to the Remain vote across the UK. That reflects the positive campaign the SNP fought, which highlighted the gains and benefits of our EU membership, and people across Scotland have responded to that positive message.

'We await the final UK-wide result, but Scotland has spoken - and spoken decisively.'

A furious Mr Salmond told the BBC: 'Scotland looks like it is going to vote solidly Remain. If there was a Leave vote in England, dragging us out the EU, I'm quite certain Nicola Sturgeon would implement the SNP manifesto.' 



The Brexit battle turned in Sunderland overnight as a huge win for the Leave campaign signaled the referendum would not end as expected.

Remain was handed four and six point leads in on-the-day opinion polls after the final ballots were closed. The results were so striking, Ukip leader Nigel Farage effectively conceded the referendum. 

But a shock result in Sunderland which saw the Out camp win by 61 per cent to 39 per cent. Analysis before the referendum had suggested Leave could be on track to win if they were more than six percentage points ahead.

A surprise victory for Brexit in Swansea, where the pro-EU side had been expecting to romp home, signposted a disastrous showing for Remain across Wales. Areas like Carmarthenshire decisively turned their back on Brussels.

Newcastle was less clear cut for the pro-EU side than they had hoped, seeing them sneak home by just 51 per cent to 49 per cent. 

Remain had some bright spots, with chunky wins in London, Scotland and Oxford. Wandsworth in particular piled in with a massive 77 per cent in favour of staying.

However, the big English cities and Scotland were not enough to offset the will of the rest of the country, and Leave passed the finishing post at 6am.

Speaking at a jubilant Leave.EU rally in central London, Mr Farage said June 23 would go down in history as 'our independence day'.

In a remark that could prove controversial after Labour MP Jo Cox was shot dead last week, Mr Farage said the country was separating from the EU 'without a single bullet being fired' .

 'Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,' he said.

'This, if the predictions now are right, this will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.

'We have fought against the multinationals, we have fought against the big merchant banks, we have fought against big politics, we have fought against lies, corruption and deceit.

Nigel Farage claims a historic win for the Leave Campaign, saying the vote is 'a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people'

A Leave campaigner celebrates in London amid scenes of utter elation with a commanding lead and just a few areas left to declare

'And today honesty, decency and belief in nation, I think now is going to win.

'And we will have done it without having to fight, without a single bullet being fired, we'd have done it by damned hard work on the ground.'

Mr Farage praised Ukip donor Arron Banks along with Labour and Tory MPs and those of 'no party' who have taken part in the Leave campaign.

He went on: 'And we'll have done it not just for ourselves, we'll have done it for the whole of Europe.

'I hope this victory brings down this failed project and leads us to a Europe of sovereign nation states, trading together, being friends together, cooperating together, and let's get rid of the flag, the anthem, Brussels, and all that has gone wrong.

'Let June 23 go down in our history as our independence day.' 

Setting the stage for another independence referendum north of the border, Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'Scotland has delivered a strong, unequivocal vote to remain in the EU, and I welcome that endorsement of our European status.

'And while the overall result remains to be declared, the vote here makes clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union.'

Tony Blair (pictured today) said the referendum decision had 'vast' implications politically and economically for Britain

The SNP leader added: 'Scotland has contributed significantly to the Remain vote across the UK. That reflects the positive campaign the SNP fought, which highlighted the gains and benefits of our EU membership, and people across Scotland have responded to that positive message.

'We await the final UK-wide result, but Scotland has spoken - and spoken decisively.'

Former first minister Alex Salmond said the ballot should take place within the next two years while negotiations were still ongoing about the UK's exit, so that Scotland could break away from Britain before it left the bloc.    



Former Europe minister and Labour MP Keith Vaz told the BBC the outcome was a 'catastrophe'. 'Frankly, in a thousand years I would never have believed that the British people would have voted this way,' he said.

'And they have done so and I think that they voted emotionally rather than looking at the facts.

'It'll be catastrophic for our country, for the rest of Europe and indeed the world.'

He added: 'The issues of immigration are extremely important, if you look at the campaign I think that there needed to be a much stronger campaign to stay in.'

Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the Conservative Party was 'utterly preoccupied with leadership infighting rather than the future of the country', adding: 'This letter cannot unsay what senior Tory politicians have been telling us for weeks - that the British people simply cannot trust David Cameron.'

Lib Dem former Cabinet minister Sir Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's authority would be 'completely gone' in the event of the Leave win.

He described holding the referendum as a 'very bad call' by the Prime Minister, who failed to understand what happens 'when you just throw the cards in the air'. 

But senior Tories rallied round in an effort to protect the PM. Cabinet minister Chris Grayling - a Brexit backer - said: 'It would be an absolute nonsense if David Cameron felt, having given the country that choice, if they take the decision he couldn't carry on the job. We are completely behind him staying, we want him to stay and that letter is a statement of commitment to his leadership.'

Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's hard-right Front National, hailed the referendum result as a 'victory for liberty' on Twitter

Before Mr Cameron's announcement, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb said he did not think the Prime Minister 'could have done any more' and it was 'absolutely essential' that he remains in No 10.

He said: 'There isn't anybody else around the Cabinet table or outside the Cabinet, for that matter, or in any of the other political parties who can give this country the kind of leadership skills and abilities that David Cameron can at this, what is going to be very challenging weeks and months for the country.'

He added: 'I just think there is a disconnect with the white working class. We didn't get our core messages across to them.

'When we tried to explain to them just how important the European Single Market was to their jobs, their livelihoods, we didn't quite land those messages successfully.

'And I think that is one of the themes that is emerging this evening is that old industrial white working class areas clearly haven't bought the message that we have tried hard to communicate.

'In those areas which are strongly perhaps white working class there will be a strong vote for Out and that's something as a Government we need to respond to.

'Clearly, I think one of the features of this referendum are some of those social divisions and clearly as a Government, as a political class, all parties, we need to show that we're responding to that.' 

Nigel Farage looked somber as he conceded defeat at around 11pm, admitting that Remain may edge the victory, but he looked overjoyed after a series of results that were better than expected for the campaign at 12.30am

Remain campaigners celebrated as the result came in for Gibraltar which voted In overwhelmingly. But it was downhill after that as Out won key battlegrounds

On the counting floor in Sunderland, there are scenes of joy as the huge win is announced, which will send ripples of hope to their fellow Brexit voters across the country 



Pro-Brexit former defence secretary Liam Fox called for a 'period of calm' and urged the Government not to invoke article 50 straight away while insisting Mr Cameron must stay on as PM.

Dr Fox told BBC News: 'A lot of things were said in advance of this referendum that we might want to think about again and that (invoking article 50) is one of them.

'I think that it doesn't make any sense to trigger article 50 without having a period of reflection first, for the Cabinet to determine exactly what it is that we're going to be seeking and in what timescale.

'And then you have to also consider what is happening with the French elections and the German elections next year and the implications that that might have for them.

'So a period of calm, a period of reflection, to let it all sink in and to work through what the actual technicalities are.' 

Nigel Farage's job as an MEP will cease to exist when we leave the EU, and he has repeatedly failed to win a seat in the House of Commons 

Young Brexiteers react with jubilation to the EU referendum results at a party thrown by Leave.EU

Business Minister Anna Soubry said: 'I will respect the result. It's a dreadful decision. We have to make the best of it.'

Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles said: 'Very sad at the decision #EUref , but that is how democracy works, so we better get on with it.' 

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he believed around two-thirds of Labour voters backed Remain. 

'A lot of Conservative voters have gone for out. There's a solid base on the Tory party for out that have gone against their own Prime Minister,' he told Sky News.

'Within the Labour vote I think it looks as though two-thirds one-third split, might be less than that, we'll see.' 

Ex Labour leader Ed Miliband said a Remain majority would be 'a vote for staying in the EU, but not a vote for the status quo in this country'.

'Whatever happens, the country will need to come together, there will need to be healing,' he said.

'It's a nation divided and the PM will have a big responsibility - particularly if it's a Remain win - to show he understands what people are saying on the Leave side of the argument.

'Labour faces that responsibility too. As far as Labour voters are concerned, there are two issues. There is obviously immigration, but beneath that there is a whole set of issues about people's lives and the fact that they don't feel politics is listening to them.' 



Ukip MEP Diane James said the large win for Leave in Sunderland could be down to anger over the local Nissan car plant writing to employees to make clear the company would prefer Britain to stay in the EU.

She told BBC News: 'Nissan, I believe, was one of those companies that was effectively asked by the Prime Minister to write a letter to the employees and I think what you're seeing here is the reaction to that, which I understand has been quite widespread across the country where people have actually taken offence at being directed to do something and then seemingly that whole message has been undermined in the later stage.' 

The Bank of England said it would take 'all necessary steps' to ensure monetary and financial stability in the wake of the Brexit vote.

'The Bank of England is monitoring developments closely,' it said in a statement.

'It has undertaken extensive contingency planning and is working closely with HM Treasury, other domestic authorities and overseas central banks. The Bank of England will take all necessary steps to meet its responsibilities for monetary and financial stability.'

But Standard & Poor's said the Brexit decision was likely to see the country lose its AAA credit rating - potentially driving up the cost of government borrowing.

Chief ratings officer Moritz Kraemer told the Financial Times: 'We think that a AAA-rating is untenable under the circumstances.'

The turnout in parts of Scotland were lower than the rest of the country, with Glasgow at 56.3%. In Glasgow 253,000 ballot papers were verified out of a total electorate of 449,806.

Moments after the polls closed at 10pm last night Mr Farage appeared to concede defeat. 

'It's been an extraordinary referendum campaign, turnout looks to be exceptionally high and it looks like Remain will edge it,' he said.

'Ukip and I are going nowhere and the party will only continue to grow stronger in the future.'   

The Leave campaign got off to a great start in Sunderland but the party didn't start prematurely at the Leave.EU party in Westminster, where volunteers eagerly await the results

But when the Sunderland result came in, Leave campaigners jumped for joy, cheered and congratulated each other after a huge win

But speaking at a Leave.EU referendum night party later as results started to flow in, Mr Farage stressed he was not ruling out a Leave victory and 'hoped and prayed' his sense defeat was wrong. 

'The Eurosceptic genie is out of the bottle. And it will now not be put back,' he said.  

Highlighting the government's controversial decision to extend voter registration deadline by two days to make up for the website going down for just a couple of hours, Mr Farage said: 'My sense of this is the government's registration scheme, getting two million voters on in the 48 hour extension maybe what tips the balance. I hope I'm wrong. I hope I am made a fool of.

'But either way, whether I am right or wrong, if we do stay part of this union it is doomed, it is finished anyway.

'If we fail tonight, it will not be us that kicks out the first brick from the wall but somebody else.'

He added: 'We are running them close, they have been scared, they have behaved pretty appallingly. 

'Win or lose this battle tonight, we will win this war, we will get our country back, we will get our independence back and we will get our borders back.' 

Early in the night Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was among senior Remain figures who voiced confidence they were on track for victory. 

She told BBC News: 'Obviously we've got a long night ahead of us. We are confident and hopeful that there will be a victory for the Remain campaign but we'll obviously have to see.' 



Nigel Farage told reporters that he thought the Remain camp had 'edged' the contest. He said the government's decision to extend the deadline for voter registration could have swung the result and pledged that the Eurosceptic 'genie will not be put back in the bottle'

If there is a Remain victory the Government will go on seeking reform in the EU, she added.

'I think if there's been a clear win then that's sending a message,' Mrs Morgan said.

'One of the things obviously is going to be implementing the reform deal the Prime Minister secured back in February.' 

Labour's Chuka Umunna said he still believed the outcome would be 'close'. 'If I was forced to call it I am reasonably confident that Remain gets a result.'  

Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, another supporter of Brexit, said her instinct was that Remain would win the vote. 



But high-profile Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith cast doubt on Mr Farage's suggestion that Remain is set for victory.

'I never quite follow what Nigel Farage says,' the former work and pensions secretary told the BBC. 'Quite often he says two different things at the same time.

'I genuinely do not have a sense of how this has gone.'  

The concern was etched into the face of Ed Miliband, former leader of the Labour party, as the referendum votes were counted

A Vote Leave source stressed that no-one could know the results yet, and suggested Mr Farage had been 'unhelpful' throughout the campaign.

Lord Ashdown said the result was 'too close to call' and insisted he had learnt not to make predictions following his promise at the general election to eat his hat after declaring the exit polls were wrong.

He said: 'Once bittten, twice shy. I suspect eat my hat has gone down into the political lexicon against my name forever.

'I don't think anybody can make a prediction, this is far too close. We are in the margin of error.'

The Liberal Democrat former leader added: 'I think there has been a bit too much hyperbole. I'm not sure the political class has covered itself in glory in this and I suspect we have an electorate that is more confused than it needs to be.' 

Brendan Chilton, general secretary of Labour Leave, said: 'Nigel may have said that but until the votes are counted we don't really know what's happened.

'It's a bit concerning if that is the case. I obviously hope we have won.'

Mr Chilton said his gut feeling at 10pm was that Leave would 'win, just'. He added: 'Even if we don't win, if it's close, that is a magnificent achievement.'  



Conservative former justice minister Damian Green said the result should 'settle it for a generation'.

'A win is a win so it should put an end to it,' he added.  

In Gibraltar, which is taking part in the referendum as a British overseas territory within the EU, turnout was a healthy 84 per cent. 

But torrential rain and flooding in the South East caused transport disruption which may have prevented some voters from reaching the ballot box in time. Some polling stations were forced to close, and two in Kingston-upon-Thames had to be relocated after becoming inundated.

As the polls closed, more than 80 Brexit rebels in David Cameron's Tory party sent a letter to Downing Street urging him to stay on as PM whatever the result.

With Mr Cameron's Remain campaign appearing on course for victory in the referendum, the group led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove reached out an olive branch.

The intention of the letter - made public as soon as polls closed in the referendum - was to begin the process of healing wounds in the Tory Party.

Some 84 Tories signed the letter to tell Mr Cameron: 'We believe whatever the British people decide you have both a mandate and a duty to continue leading the nation implementing our policies.'

As well as Mr Johnson and Mr Gove, the signatories included Cabinet-level Brexit backers Chris Grayling and John Whittingdale, but not Iain Duncan Smith, who quit as work and pensions secretary shortly before the referendum.

Tory MP Robert Syms said that two-thirds of Conservative MPs who broke with the PM to back Leave had signed the letter, but said it had not been possible to reach all of them to ask them to sign. 

Mr Duncan Smith said he was not asked to sign the letter but insisted Mr Cameron should stay on as PM.

Mr Duncan Smith told BBC News: 'Actually I wasn't asked to sign the letter but I've been very public all along to say that I think he has a duty to stay.

'I'm not in government any longer so I assume that's why I wasn't asked - I'm just a backbencher.'

Mr Farage's early pessimism about the prospects for Brexit triggered a rise in the value of Sterling by almost a cent against the dollar as the markets breathed a sigh of relief. 



The counter at Sunderland rushes to get the results through in the city first to return their verdict in tonight's referendum 

Boris Johnson hijacked his own daughter's graduation earlier today by unveiling a Brexit banner with just hours to go until polls close in the historic EU referendum 

As his 22-year-old daughter Lara was enjoying her big day at St Andrews University in Fife, Scotland, the leading Vote Leave campaigner waved a poster with the words: 'Last chance to vote'. 

But one student defied the ex-London Mayor by marching up to collect her degree with a Remain poster of her own as voters went to the polls across the country. 

Mr Johnson performed the stunt as he sat in the balcony of the Younger Hall alongside his wife Marina Wheeler QC, revealing the poster to the packed audience and causing mayhem as students then unveiled their own 'Remain' messages to the crowds. 

Lara Johnson was awarded a degree in Latin and Comparative Literature from the Scottish university. Her dad flew up to Scotland for the occasion, posing for selfies with excited students after four months of hard-fought campaigning to persuade voters to back Britain leaving the EU. 

Ali West said she could not pass up the opportunity to make the Remain case to Mr Johnson, insisting: 'Boris Johnson was in the audience at my graduation today, so naturally I had some thoughts.' 

Speaking this evening, the Leave champion said: 'From what I have heard and all the information is that turnout is good in areas where we need it to be.'  





Regional Counting Officer Sue Stanhope announces the turnout for Sunderland as 64.9 per cent and Leave emerge victorious with 61.3 per cent of the vote. It's a good start for Brexit as experts said that a six per cent lead would suggest the vote would finish tied

Pollsters have been left licking their wounds after following up on their abject failure to predict last year's general election result by calling the referendum wrong.

Last night a flurry of eve-of-referendum polls suggested the result is still too close to call. 

A YouGov poll for The Times gave Remain a lead of 51 to 49. FTI Consulting gave Remain the edge by 51.4 per cent to 48.6 per cent once 'don't knows' are taken out.

YouGov chief Peter Kellner has admitted that the failure was 'embarrassing'. 



Two further polls by Opinium and TNS showed the reverse, with Leave on 51 per cent and Remain on 49 per cent. 



Opinium Research recorded a tiny lead for Brexit in its final survey of 3,000 voters this week as it found 45 per cent backed Leave and 44 per cent backed Remain.

But after taking into account the margin of error in the study, the firm declared it impossible to predict a winner.

A week ago, Opinium had the referendum tied at 44 per cent each while at the start of June the pollster had Remain ahead 43-41.

The poll fits with the mixed found by all of the polling firms in the last week of the race, with some results showing small leads for either side while other showed a tie.

By contrast, betting markets have continued to show Remain as the strong favourite as the race enters its final hours. 





Adam Drummond, of Opinium Research said: 'This really is ''too close to call'' territory with undecided voters holding the balance of the vote in their hands.

'Although referendum campaigns normally see a move back to the status quo as we get closer to polling day, this hasn't yet shown up in our polls and the Remain camp will have to hope that it happens in the polling booth itself if Britain is to stay in the European Union.' 

In its latest poll, Opinium interviewed 3,011 voters between Monday and Wednesday. 



David Cameron delivering his resignation statement this morning

The country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise – perhaps the biggest in our history. Over 33 million people – from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar – have all had their say.

We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people with these big decisions.

We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed, there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves - and that is what we have done.

The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.

I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument, including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believed was the national interest.

And let me congratulate all those who took part in the leave campaign – for the spirited and passionate case that they made.

The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered. It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision.

So there can be no doubt about the result.

Across the world people have been watching the choice that Britain has made. I would reassure those markets and investors that Britain's economy is fundamentally strong.

And I would also reassure Brits living in European countries and European citizens living here that there will be no immediate changes in your circumstances. There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.

We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union. This will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Governments, to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced.

But above all this will require strong, determined and committed leadership.

I am very proud and very honoured to have been Prime Minister of this country for six years.

I believe we have made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history; with reforms to welfare and education; increasing people's life chances; building a bigger and stronger society; keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world, and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality.

But above all restoring Britain's economic strength, and I am grateful to everyone who has helped to make that happen.

I have also always believed that we have to confront big decisions – not duck them.

That's why we delivered the first Coalition government in seventy years to bring our economy back from the brink. It's why we delivered a fair, legal and decisive referendum in Scotland. And why I made the pledge to renegotiate Britain's position in the European Union and hold a referendum on our membership, and have carried those things out.

I fought this campaign in the only way I know how – which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel – head, heart and soul.

I held nothing back.

I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone – not the future of any single politician, including myself.

But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.

I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to steady the ship over the coming weeks and months, but I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.

This is not a decision I have taken lightly, but I do believe it is in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required.

There is no need for a precise timetable today, but in my view we should aim to have a new Prime Minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October.

Delivering stability will be important and I will continue in post as Prime Minister with my Cabinet for the next three months. The Cabinet will meet on Monday.

The Governor of the Bank of England is making a statement about the steps that the Bank and the Treasury are taking to reassure financial markets. We will also continue taking forward the important legislation that we set before Parliament in the Queen's Speech. And I have spoken to Her Majesty the Queen this morning to advise her of the steps that I am taking.

A negotiation with the European Union will need to begin under a new Prime Minister, and I think it is right that this new Prime Minister takes the decision about when to trigger article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.

I will attend the European Council next week to explain the decision the British people have taken and my own decision.

The British people have made a choice. That not only needs to be respected – but those on the losing side of the argument, myself included, should help to make it work.

Britain is a special country.

We have so many great advantages.

A parliamentary democracy where we resolve great issues about our future through peaceful debate; a great trading nation, with our science and arts, our engineering and our creativity respected the world over.

And while we are not perfect, I do believe we can be a model of a multi-racial, multi-faith democracy, where people can come and make a contribution and rise to the very highest that their talent allows.

Although leaving Europe was not the path I recommended, I am the first to praise our incredible strengths. I have said before that Britain can survive outside the European Union and indeed that we could find a way.

Now the decision has been made to leave, we need to find the best way, and I will do everything I can to help.

I love this country – and I feel honoured to have served it.

And I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.
