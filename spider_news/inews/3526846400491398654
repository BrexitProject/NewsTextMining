Lindsay Lohan live-tweets the EU referendum results

2016-06-24

As Brexit pundits go, Lindsay Lohan is an unlikely candidate but the Hollywood celebrity has been enthusiastically airing her views on the referendum, sharing her thoughts with her 9.3 million followers in a series of Twitter and Instagram posts.

The actress, who is best known for her role in the 2004 cult hit Mean Girls, came out in support of Remain shortly after the result in Sunderland was announced.

One of the first areas to declare a result, the city voted to quit the EU by a significant margin, with 61 per cent backing Leave. Following the announcement Ms Lohan, who is in the UK having attended a charity ball in London earlier this week, told her followers: “#besmart pay attention and work hard to buy [Chanel] #remain [sic]”

Apparently unfamiliar with the geography of the UK, the actress asked: “Where’s Sunderland? Does Sarah Palin live there?”

The Freaky Friday actress has continued to live-tweet the referendum, coming out in support of Remain.

After it was announced Shetland had voted to stay in the EU, Ms Lohan hailed the decision and expressed her approval, saying: “I love the #Shetlands…Thank goodness we have pure hearted people our side #besmart #ShetlandsVSSunderland #BringItOn [sic].”

Commenting on the pound plunging, Ms Lohan said: “Good luck with the pound. Will take you about 15 years to get it back up. #Remain instead.”

Some users of the social media site have queried the actress’s sobriety but others have welcomed her unexpected interest in British politics.
