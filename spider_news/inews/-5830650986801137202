This first episode of the spin-off from the adult version of Channel 4’s cult reality show subjected its unfeasibly cute and precocious charges to a pretty varied programme menu, ranging from The Undateables to US presidential campaign coverage and blockbuster Hollywood movies.

The little ‘uns proved as rich a source of classic put-downs and random observations as the grown-ups.

These included a withering assessment of Donald Trump; pondering whether a Brexit might mean “we can’t be in Eurovision any more and we won’t have spaghetti” (don’t say you weren’t warned); and a measured, solemnly delivered conclusion that the film Twilight is “made entirely of stares”.

On second thoughts, let’s keep these people off our screens – they make this reviewing lark look far too easy.
