Boris Johnson gambled on his career by backing Leave – and it paid off

2016-06-24

He gambled his career on backing Brexit knowing that a vote to leave would pretty much guarantee that a figure from that camp would become the next Conservative leader and by default, the next Prime Minister. That gamble paid off for Boris Johnson yesterday.

But as he savoured his triumph, he was given a taste of the lonely life at the top, and the vitriol he stirred up during the campaign.

“Scum” and “shame”, bystanders screamed as crowds blocked his car as it made its way through traffic.

His decision to back the Leave campaign was viewed by many as an opportunistic pitch for the leadership and now, as one of the most well-known political figures in the country and popular figures in his party, he looks like the candidate to beat. It is now almost certain he will throw his hat into the ring despite always dodging questions about his desire to be Prime Minister in the past, once saying it was as likely as being reincarnated as an olive or finding Elvis on Mars.

Without mentioning the top job yesterday, he delivered a diplomatic pitch for the leadership. Describing David Cameron as a “brave and principled” man, he expressed sorrow at his decision to resign. He thanked voters for trusting his plan to leave the EU and sought to reassure Remain voters we will be no less European despite cutting ties with Brussels.

Insisting there was “no need for haste”, he said “nothing would change over the short term except that work will have to begin on how to give effect to the will of the people and how to extricate this country from the supranational system.”

“This does not mean that the United Kingdom will be any less united, nor any less European,” he said. “It think the very opposite is true.”

He added: “We cannot turn our backs on Europe. We are part of Europe.”
