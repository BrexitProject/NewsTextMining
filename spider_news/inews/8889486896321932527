Britain is now a divided nation

2016-06-23

We look like a divided country. No one can claim that this vote has ended a national argument. Instead, it has started one.

Few among us obsessed about the European Union six months ago. Of course, the EU frustrated some of us (even many of us), but it didn’t occupy our conversation.

The EU has become a locus for grievances, and in doing so it has pitched groups of us against one another.

Age, class, education and geography have become starker dividing lines. Perhaps that is a price worth paying for the most important political decision we have made for decades.

But it leaves us in need of national healing.

Remainers are more likely to be younger, university-educated, or living in Scotland, Northern Ireland or cities (London, Bristol, Manchester, Oxford, Cambridge, Cardiff, Brighton…). Leavers tend to be older and live elsewhere, especially country and coast.

While every election is divisive, few pit the well-off against the have-nots like this referendum has.

Most of the the metropolitan political (and media) classes don’t understand how to address people who blame immigrants for low wages, high housing costs and crummy access to public services.

That’s one reason why immigration has lost mass consent at a time of relative national affluence.

We have seen restlessness at Europe’s political extremes, most notably in Austria, France, Spain and Greece.

Britain’s Brexit vote has engaged the public in huge numbers – but done little to foster trust in our leaders. The stage is set for such an individual to emerge, who can restore faith in our politics.
