Lord Sugar under fire over ‘immigrant’ attack on Labour MP

2016-06-22

Lord Alan Sugar has been hit by a social media backlash after saying a pro-Brexit campaigner should not “tell us British what we should do” because she was born in Germany.

The Apprentice boss, who supports Remain, criticised the involvement of the Labour MP Gisela Stuart in BBC1’s final debate on European Union membership.

Referring to her by her maiden name, he tweeted: “I find it strange that Gisela Gschaider a 1974 immigrant from Germany is on the Brexit panel telling us British what we should do.”

“That is disgraceful.

She is as British as you are.”

Ms Stuart, the 60-year-old Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, moved to Britain at the age of 19 to improve her English.

She is the most high-profile Labour supporter of Brexit and appeared alongside former London Mayor Boris Johnson and energy minister Andrea Leadsom to make the case for a Leave vote.

The peer’s comments provoked widespread anger. The former Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted: “Lord Sugar PIG.”

The Leave-backing Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi told the peer: “You must withdraw and apologise to Gisela. That is disgraceful. She is as British as you are.”

The Britain Stronger In campaign condemned Lord Sugar’s remarks as “completely unacceptable and inappropriate”.

But he was unrepentant, arguing that Ms Stuart was an immigrant who was now arguing against immigration.

He said in a series of tweets: “Yes she is [British] now, and has been arguing that we need to curb immigrants from the EU. She immigrated to UK from Germany in 1974.

“30 mins ago was advocating that we stop immigration from the EU like Germany in future and exit EU.”

Retweeting someone who called him racist, the peer said: “You ignorant fool. How can my comment be classified as racist. Crawl back under your rock.”
