David Cameron resigns

2016-06-24

Prime Minister David Cameron has announced his resignation. After a historic referendum on membership of the EU, which Leave won by 52% to 48%, Mr Cameron, who campaigned to remain in the 28-country- bloc, stepped down. He said he has informed the Queen of his decision and he intends there will be a new leader in place by October – the start of the Conservative Party conference.

David Cameron stood on the steps of Downing Street telling reporters: “The country has just taken part in a giant democratic exercise, perhaps the biggest in our history.

“Over 33 million people from England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar have all had their say.

“We should be proud of the fact that in these islands we trust the people for these big decisions.

“We not only have a parliamentary democracy, but on questions about the arrangements for how we’ve governed there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves and that is what we have done. The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.”

This announcement comes just a year after Mr Cameron won a General Election, achieving a majority government for the Conservative Party. Mr Cameron said he was not the right person to negotiate with the EU over the UK’s exit from the Union – he said fresh leadership was needed to invoke Article 50, which triggers the UK leaving.

“I am fully aware of how serious or even dramatic this moment is politically,” he said.

“I love this country and I feel honoured to have served it and I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed,” he said.

More than £100 billion was wiped off the FTSE 100 as the index fell more than 7%, while the pound also crashed 8% against the US dollar. England and Wales voted strongly for Brexit, while London, Scotland and Northern Ireland backed staying in the EU.
