The man named as the suspect in the killing of Jo Cox has been described as a “loner” as police began to investigate whether he had links with far-right extremists.

Mr Mair’s half-brother Duane St Louis told ITV News that his sibling had “never been in trouble in his life”, adding: “He’s not like that, he wouldn’t hurt a fly”.

He added that he’d spoken to Mr Mair’s mother and she is “shocked and can’t understand what has happened”.

He wasn’t aware of Mr Mair having anything to do with guns or knives, he said and asked if his brother was racist he said “no chance”.
