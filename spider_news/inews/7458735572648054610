Birmingham bookshop flood destroys 900 copies of the nation’s favourite novels

2016-06-21

Booksellers at Britain’s tallest bookshop were left distraught after a flash flood destroyed £9,000-worth of the country’s best-loved paperbacks.

Staff at Waterstones in Birmingham’s High Street were faced with having to bin 900 novels when the fiction department was swamped in last week’s downpours.

The deluge happened only months after the nine-storey 1930s Art Deco shop reopened after a major refit. Water entered through the front door and cascaded downstairs into the basement.

The water seemed to have a way of finding the best books and the ones we loved the most.

One-third of the store’s fiction books were destroyed and local author Mike Gayle had to postpone the launch of his latest novel, Hope Family Calendar.

The shop had been fitted with drainage “moats” to stop it flooding after a previous flooded five years ago.

Stuart Bartholomew, regional manager for Waterstones, said: “It was heartbreaking to see our favourite novels destroyed. The water seemed to have a way of finding the best books and all the ones we loved the most.

“Staff coped with the shock by tweeting names of books about floods. Strangely, not a single poetry book was damaged.

“People have asked us what we are going to do with the books, but they are so badly damaged that they are unreadable. If you picked one up, the pages would tear and fall out.

“We’ve never seen a day like it, but customers have been very understanding.”

The shop has now been restocked and Mr Gayle’s book launch is rescheduled to take place tonight.
