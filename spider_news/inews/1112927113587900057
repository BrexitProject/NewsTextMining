EU referendum result: 5 key quotes from Westminster

2016-06-24

The Brexit campaign has won with a 51.9 per cent majority over the Remain camp. Here is how Westminster reacted to the result, in five key quotes:

“We fought against the multinationals, we fought against the big merchant banks, we fought against big politics, we fought against lies, corruption and deceit, and today, honesty, decency and belief in nation I think now is going to win.”

“The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected,” said Mr Cameron. “The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered.

“I love this country and I feel honoured to have served it and I will do everything I can in future to help this great country succeed.”

“Article 50 needs to be invoked now. Many communities are fed up with cuts and very angry. The message is that many communities are fed up with cuts and economic dislocation.

“Clearly there are very difficult days ahead. There will be job consequences.”

“I feel so proud to be British this morning. The hectoring, the bullying, the scare-stories failed to dent our resolve… The task now is to unite the country, to move in a measured and phased way to a status that both Leavers and Remainers can accept.”

“This self-inflicted wound will be Cameron’s legacy. This is his failing. And when the call went out to Jeremy Corbyn, he refused to answer. Their self-interested political manoeuvring has taken our country to the brink, and we are toppling over the edge.”
