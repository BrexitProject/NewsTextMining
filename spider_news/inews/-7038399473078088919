Jo Cox memorial page raises more than £1 million in three days

2016-06-20

The memorial fund set up for Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered, has raised more than £1 million in just three days.

Jo Cox, 41, was shot and stabbed in her constituency of Batley and Spen on 16 June. The GoFundMe page, entitled Jo Cox’s Fund, was set up by her friends and her husband Brendan.

More than 30,500 people have given to the fund but it was a donation of £6,000 – from someone called David Newton – which led the total to surpass the £1 million mark just before 8:30pm.

“The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo’s family,” said Tim Dixon, one of Ms Cox’s friends.

“It shows how powerfully Jo’s story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud,” he added.

The money will be donated to three charities supported by Ms Cox: The Royal Voluntary Service, HOPE not hate and The White Helmets, which funds work in Syria.

Earlier, MPs honoured Ms Cox in the House of Commons.

“We have lost one of our own and our society has lost one of our very best,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. “She spent her life serving and campaigning for other people – whether as a worker for Oxfam or for the anti-slavery charity the Freedom Fund, as a political activist and as a feminist.”

A series of events have been organised for Wednesday, which would have been Ms Cox’s 42nd birthday. Gatherings will take place in Batley and Spen, London, the US and Europe.

“On the day Jo would have been 42, we are asking everyone, everywhere to love like Jo loved,” the event page reads.

Ms Cox was attacked outside the library in Birstall where she had been holding an advice surgery.

Thomas Mair, 52, has been charged with her murder.
