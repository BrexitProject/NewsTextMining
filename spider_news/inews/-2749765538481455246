What time will the referendum result be declared where you live?

2016-06-23

Trying to figure out if you can stay up and wait for the votes to be counted? These are the expected declaration times of the various counts around the country.

Sporting Index, the leading political spread betting company, predicts that Sunderland will be the first to declare, as it has been in recent general elections. But other counts, in London’s City and Wandsworth and Foyle in Northern Ireland, also expect early declarations.

Elsewhere, things are expected to drag on until 7am. And unlike a general election, the picture won’t become clear until deep into the night because all the votes are feeding into one big pool.

Will you make it until your area’s result is known?
