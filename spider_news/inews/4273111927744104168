Nigel Farage: Leave campaign pledges ‘mistake’, may not be upheld

2016-06-24

The dust has barely settled on on the EU referendum, but prominent Leave campaigners are already seemingly backpedalling on their pledges in the lead-up to the vote.

The NHS was one of the main campaigning issues in the referendum. Emblazoned across the Leave campaign’s battle bus were the words: “We send the EU £350 million a week, let’s fund our NHS instead”.

However immediately after the vote, Ukip leader Nigel Farage – who campaigned to leave the EU whilst not being an official part of the campaign, said he could not guarantee that post Brexit, the  NHS could get an extra £350million in funding.

He branded the pledge a “mistake.”

Asked on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Farage said: “No, I can’t [guarantee that the NHS would get the money] and I would never have made that claim – it was one of the mistakes that the Leave campaign made.”

Mr Farage went on: “It wasn’t one of my adverts. I think they made a mistake. They made a mistake in doing that. We have a £10 billion a year, £34 million a day featherbed – that is going to be free money that we can spend on the NHS, on schools, or whatever it is.”

Notions that a Leave vote would lead to curbs on immigration were undermined by key Leave campaigner Daniel Hannan.

“Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the EU, they are going to be disappointed,” he told the BBC. “Of course there is still going to be immigration, there are still going to be people coming here to work, and you will look in vain for anything that the Leave campaign said at any point that ever suggested there would ever be any kind of border closure or drawing up of the drawbridge.”
