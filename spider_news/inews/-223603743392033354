Sir Philip Green’s £46m private jet – what you need to know

2016-06-20

Sir Philip Green has reportedly taken delivery of a new private jet. The arrival of the £46m Gulfstream G650ER – dubbed the “holy grail of private jets” – came as the tycoon remained embroiled in an inquiry into the collapse of BHS.

The demise of the high-street chain has put 11,000 jobs and £571m pensions at risk. With that in mind, it’s unlikely his former employees will be wishing Sir Philip a happy holiday.



The beleaguered Arcadia Group billionaire, who is facing calls to be stripped of his knighthood, was grilled by MPs for nearly six hours last week over the £400m in dividends taken out of BHS during his 15-year ownership, his management of the pension scheme, and the sale of the firm for £1 last year to the former racing car driver and bankrupt Dominic Chappell, who had no retail experience.

Sir Philip’s impressive collection of luxury vehicles already features three yachts, including a four-storey 90-metre vessel with a £100m price tag, but if he’s looking for a speedy getaway, the G650ER, which has a top speed of 680mph, can’t be beaten, as these vital statistics illustrate.


Maximum range: 7,500 nautical miles
Maximum operating speed: 0.925 mach
Number of passengers: 8
Number of aircraft produced: 181
Amount of money Sir Philip’s wife, Lady Tina, is reportedly spending on redecorating the interior: £300,000
Frequency with which cabin is replenished with fresh air: every two minutes
