In her 13 months in Parliament, Jo Cox established a reputation as a principled, independent-minded MP who worked hard for her constituents and for humanitarian causes, including helping Syrian refugees.

A message from the GoFundMe page told donors: “We are overwhelmed by everyone’s incredible generosity and so grateful for your donations.”
