British gay couple ‘laughed at’ because they have a son

2016-06-16

A British gay couple claimed they were “laughed at” and “embarrassed” by staff of Emirates Airlines after they tried to check in with their son.

Lee Charlton was travelling from Manchester to Durban with his partner, Jason, and their young son, Kieran, when they stopped over at Dubai International Airport late last month.

The 42-year-old, who appears to have been unaware that gay men living in the United Arab Emirates can be sentenced to death or life in prison, said in a Facebook post that they were given a “quizzical look” by a woman at the Emirates check-in desk when they handed over their documents.

“She asked me if Kieran was my brother, to which I replied ‘no, my son’,” he wrote, adding that “a look of surprise” crossed her face when Jason gave the same answer and she called her manager over. “I asked if it was because we are gay and I was laughed at,” he wrote. “I’ve never felt so embarrassed.”

The pair were allegedly “asked to wait in a room” for almost two hours while the airport investigated their clearance to travel and they nearly missed their connecting flight.

A spokesman for the airline, a subsidiary of the Emirates Group, which is wholly owned by the state-owned Investment Corporation of Dubai, said it was “sorry to hear about Mr Charlton’s complaint”.
