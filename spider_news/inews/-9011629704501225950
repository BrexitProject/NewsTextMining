What does Brexit mean for our human rights?

2016-06-24

Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will not automatically affect its status as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), according to experts. The rights afforded to British citizens by the ECHR are protected in UK law thanks to the 1998 Human Rights Act.

However, following last year’s General Election, the Government announced plans to repeal the Human Rights Act, replacing it with a Bill of Rights.

The controversial plans to break the formal link between the British courts and the European Court of Human Rights is a cause for concern for many. Amnesty International warned if the plans are pushed through the “universal freedoms” currently enjoyed by all British citizens could turn into “privileges for a chosen few”.

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, which represents the vast majority of trade unionists in Britain, said in the run-up to the referendum rights such as paid holidays, emergency parental leave, life-saving health and safety protections and time off for antenatal appointments would “all be up for review” in the event of a Brexit.

Sophie Walker, leader of the Women’s Equality Party has called for “urgent measures” to “retain and expand the vital rights and protections” created as a result of Britain’s EU membership.

“The EU prompted Britain to introduce legislation insisting on equal pay, maternity leave and protection from sexual harassment in the workplace,” Ms Walker said.

“Now Britain must lead the way among its former partners to champion these rights and set out clear targets for the next, pressing advance of women’s equality.”

In 2010 Nigel Farage criticised the “foolishness” of the European Parliament for voting for increased maternity pay.
