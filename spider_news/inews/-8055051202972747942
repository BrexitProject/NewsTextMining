Jo Cox was planning to launch a report in Parliament warning of an increase in anti-Muslim attacks, particularly against women.

The Labour MP for Batley and Spen, who died after being shot and stabbed in her constituency on Thursday, was planning to introduce a report she had been working on with the Islamophobia watchdog Tell Mama.

The report by Tell Mama, an organisation that monitors anti-Muslim incidents, warns of rising aggression by far-right nationalists and an increase in Islamophobia in the last year.

Fiyaz Mughal, the director of Tell Mama, told The Times there were significant clusters of far-right activity in Yorkshire and that the charity’s annual report would detail an increase in anti-Muslim activity in the UK in the last year.

“In the last 18 months South Yorkshire is one of the leading areas in the country (for Islamophobic incidents),” Mr Mughal said.

According to the newspaper, the MP had also recorded a video about preventing Islamophobia, which she planned to launch on 29 June.

The video shows her saying she had spoken to Tell Mama about preventing Islamophobia and discussing the problem that in her constituency “many of our young women don’t feel safe when they’re out on the street”.
