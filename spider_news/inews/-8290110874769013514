Man stopped by police for leaving union flag tribute for murdered MP Jo Cox

2016-06-17

A man was stopped by police after leaving a Union flag in front of the floral tributes for murdered MP Jo Cox in the village where she was killed.

The Union flag has, for some, become increasingly toxic after being adopted by the far-right. It is a symbol of a number of nationalist organisations, including the British National Party.

Farran Van der Hyden said he was not a member of any group after he laid the flag with the message “1974 – 2016 RIP Jo Cox MP” in the village of Birstall.

He said: “The police asked me if I was part of any group but I’m not. I’m just a normal guy, paying my respects.

”I’m a Christian, I’m born and bred in England, I don’t believe in violence or that anyone should be killed in cold blood.

“I just came to lay this flag. She was one of the MPs of Britain so I think it’s a mark of respect to lay a British flag.”

The i contacted West Yorkshire Police for a comment.
