A man has been arrested on suspicion of assault after a row about the EU referendum ended with a man being hit in the face.

Police were called on Sunday after reports of an assault outside House of Fraser, English Street, Carlisle.

A 78-year-old man, who was reportedly handing out leaflets for the IN campaign, was struck in the face following an argument about the EU, suffering minor injuries

Police were called at 10.48am and a 52 year old man was arrested by police shortly after the incident.

A spokesman for Cumbria Police said the pair had “an altercation about the EU referendum”.

The investigation into this assault continues, however police are appealing for anyone who witnessed this assault or has any information about the incident to come forward and make contact with Cumbria Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The EU referendum takes place on Thursday.  The rival camps in the battle over Brexit are mounting a frantic 48 final hours of campaigning amid fresh evidence that the outcome of the European Union membership referendum remains too close to call.

The latest opinion poll put Remain on 53 per cent and Leave on 47 per cent – a finding that confirms the result is on a knife edge.

NatCen Social Research, the social research organisation which conducted the survey, said the prospect of a Leave victory could not be ruled out.

Kirby Swales, the director of NatCen’s research centre, said: “These findings suggest the public is fairly evenly split. While we have Remain slightly ahead, there is everything to play for in the final days of the campaign.”

Its survey was conducted using methods recommended by the inquiry into the failure pollsters to forecast last year’s general election result.

After a surge for Leave last week in the polls last week, recent surveys have suggested backing for the EU has recovered to put the two sides on level pegging.
