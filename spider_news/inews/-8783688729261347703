Richard Branson wants us to vote Remain – but he’s only out for himself

It’s strange that Sir Richard Branson should emerge from the Virgin Islands to offer his opinion on Brexit so late in the campaign.

About 15 years ago he emerged from the ether supporting the establishment’s view at the time that we should join the euro. On a live edition of Panorama – in which he was the business spokesperson in favour of the euro and I spoke against – I thought he was strangely incoherent and monosyllabic, and I formed the strong impression that he had neither carried out much research nor had much conviction on the subject.

In any event, like so many who supported Tony Blair’s view on the euro, he was ennobled shortly after the failure of the campaign. Was there was any connection between his late intervention and this subsequent rise in status?

What is certain is that almost everyone in the UK now knows or believes that Branson’s judgement on the issue of the euro, using arguments which are similar to those he uses today to support Remain, was flawed.

Branson’s idea of doing business seems to be to do his level best to ingratiate himself with governments – which I imagine has benefits in areas where governments hold huge sway, such as rail and air transport, telecoms and banking.

However, I don’t believe for a millisecond that this arch-opportunist has very much more than his own best interests at heart in making this late appearance in the referendum campaign.
I would personally bet any money that he’s recently had a pleading phone call from No 10.
