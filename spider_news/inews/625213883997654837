The likelihood of Turkey ever joining the EU: the facts

2016-06-17

Turkey, along with Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are “in the queue” to join the EU. This means that between 2.58 million and 5.23 million people could be added to the UK population by 2030.

Negotiations on Turkey’s accession into the EU are “rapidly accelerating,” say Brexit campaigners Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.

A deal brokered between the EU and Turkey – aimed at tackling the migrant and refugee crisis – has put more force behind Turkey’s bid to become a member of the EU.

Allowing Turkey to join the EU will give it access to the bloc’s “freedom of movement” laws and mean that many more people can travel to Britain to live and work.

Britain does not have the power to veto Turkey’s accession, says defence minister Penny Mordaunt.

Turkey joining the EU is a slow process. “It is a long, slow process by which we hope that Turkey will gradually, over a period of many years, adopt more and more European norms and European values,” says Foreign Secretary and Remainer Philip Hammond.

Britain has the power to veto the accession of any state to the EU, allowing the nation to block any membership deemed “inappropriate” and consider the terms of the future membership of any county.

Turkey’s accession into the EU is being used to scare people and it should not even be a factor in the referendum debate, says former foreign secretary William Hague.

There are still issues for Turkey to address, including its partition of Cyprus, before it becomes a member.
