Jo Cox MP murder: Facts minus speculation

2016-06-16

Labour MP Jo Cox, a married mother of two, has died after being shot and stabbed in her constituency of Batley and Spen, near Leeds.

This is what we know – the facts minus the speculation:

“She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn’t have a creed, race or religion, it is poisonous.”

“The whole of the Labour Party and Labour family – and indeed the whole country – will be in shock at the horrific murder of Jo Cox today. Jo had a lifelong record of public service and a deep commitment to humanity.”

Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader
