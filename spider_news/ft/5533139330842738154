Futures signal no Fed rate rise until ’18

2016-06-24

The vote for Brexit may have stayed the Federal Reserve’s hand until 2018.

Federal funds futures contracts rallied overnight and into the start of New York trade on Friday after the UK voted to leave the EU — as traders shifted their bets of when the US central bank would next tighten policy —, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.

Bids on fed funds futures contracts through August 2018 were quoted at a rate below 0.625 per cent, the next incremental 25 basis point move the Fed is expected to take. A day earlier, as momentum had appeared to favour the Remain campaign, contracts for July 2017 priced in one rate rise by the Fed. Rates on the contracts decline as their underlying prices rise.

“There is a real panic after the vote last night and a lot of investors seem to think this takes the Fed out for the rest of the year,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance. “I’m not sure about this yet but they could be right.”

Traders are pricing a very shallow pace of rate increases, below forecasts provided by individual policymakers at the Fed last week. The median projection from the central bank’s rate setting group was for two hikes in 2016 followed by three each in 2017 and 2018.

The market has over the past year predicted more dovish Fed policy than both economists surveyed by the FT and the US central bank itself.
