Separation may be the making of a new Europe

2016-06-24

Sir, Letâ€™s be thankful for Brexit. Yes, it will be a tortuous journey that hopefully will take the UK and Europe in new directions. In any separation, couples or countries have to adjust. Before closing the door on any separation, it is important for couples and countries to digest and understand the reasons, before opening new doors.

We need a new Europe with federalised powers in certain areas. Now that the UK has to negotiate an Out, others will be tempted. Europe should call a constitutional meeting to which the UK and international observers are invited to create a new Europe, with less bureaucracy, fewer ridiculous regulations and an effective central bank. Thank you, Britain, although it may well be reduced to thank you, England.
