S&P 500 set for longest losing streak since August

2016-06-16

US stocks were lower for a sixth consecutive day as investors digested the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision and concerns continue to mount over the UK’s referendum on its EU membership.

The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,057.80 — if the benchmark index were to hold on to these losses it would clock its longest losing streak since August.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6 per cent to 17,531.52, while the Nasdaq Composite also declined 0.7 per cent to 4,799.82.

The drop comes a day after the Federal Reserve opted to leave its rates unchanged and trimmed its long-run forecast for the federal funds rate, with Fed chair Janet Yellen noting during her press conference that concerns about a Brexit were a factor in the central bank’s decision.

With less than eight days to go before the UK votes on whether they want to stay in the EU or not, recent polls are showing that the ‘Leave’ campaign has strengthened its lead over the ‘Remain’ camp.

Gold continues to be bolster by the weak dollar and market uncertainty, advancing 1.4 per cent to $1,310.21 an ounce and touching its highest level in two years on Wednesday.

“Gold is playing off the market’s uncertainty on global rates and the continuously growing fears of the UK voting to leave the EU on the 23rrd of June, Amaryllis Gryllaki at TD securities, said.
