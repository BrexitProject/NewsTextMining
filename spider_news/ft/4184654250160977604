FTSE 100 clocks best day since February

2016-06-20

The FTSE 100 just clocked its biggest one day gain since February* as the Remain camp regained momentum leading up to Thursday’s referendum.

The FTSE 100, which had advanced as much as 3.6 per cent earlier in the day — failed to hold on to the gains that would have helped it post its biggest one-day gain since 2011.

Meanwhile, the sterling soared on Monday rising 2.24 per cent to 1.4679 per US dollar — poised for its biggest one-day rally since 2008.

Note: The post was amended to reflect it was the biggest one-day gain since February.
