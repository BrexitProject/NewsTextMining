Referendum is the first of four serious events

2016-06-16

Sir, Martin Wolf’s analysis “ Brexit imperils the confidence of strangers” (June 15) is spot on as regards the detrimental effects that a possible Brexit would have both on the UK and the wider world. Over the next 15 months, four of the world’s six largest economies face stiff electoral challenges — a point that Simon Kuper has also alluded to in FT Weekend. The UK’s EU referendum is the first in a line of four events that could all have serious implications for international political, economic and social co-operation.

For Britain, a vote to leave would drag down the UK economy, have serious negative implications for the European and world economies and cause widespread disharmony and uncertainty. It would also give credence to populists’ arguments.

Next up is the US general election in November, followed by the French presidential elections in May 2017 and the German parliamentary elections in September 2017. For those of us who do not wish to see Brexit, Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen as presidents and the Alternative für Deutschland in government, it is clear what it is we need to do: get involved, roll up our sleeves and get stuck in.

In the case of the first of these challenges and the one that is most pressing — the UK’s EU referendum — we all have to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves one simple question: “Would I be happy not having played my part, and waking up on June 24 to see the UK no longer in the EU?” The answer should be self-evident for all of us who believe in international and European co-operation. 

The time for talking is over. The time for action is now.
