Deutsche Bank shares hit all-time low

2016-06-16

Shares in Deutsche Bank have slumped to their lowest ever level as European bank stocks across the board are taking a battering in a record low bond yield environment.

Stock in the German national champion slipped another 2.4 per cent in early trading on Thursday to an intraday low of €12.83, surpassing the depths reached during the financial crisis.

Its shares have now tanked by 41 per cent this year, and suffered a humbling 87 per cent decline since reaching a pre-financial crisis peak in April 2007. Its market capitalisation now stands at €18.25bn.

Deutsche is one of the biggest fallers in European banking stocks today.

Shares in Spain’s Bankia are down 2.45 per cent, Italy’s Unicredit is down 1.86 per cent, while Deutsche’s German rival Commerzbank has fallen 1.65 per cent. France’s Credit Agricole has slipped 1.46 per cent and Société Générale is down 1 per cent.

Banks stocks are suffering as jittery investors have rushed to put their money in the safest government debt, pushing yields down to record lows in Germany, Japan, the UK and Switzerland.

With just a week before Britain’s EU vote, the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank have all warned of the fall-out of a Brexit vote for growth and financial markets in the last 24 hours.
