Miner to list on Aim despite Brexit

2016-06-24

Bacanora Minerals, the Mexico focused lithium group,​ ​​​revealed plans on Friday to list on London’s small-cap exchange, Aim, despite the UK’s vote to leave the EU.

The company which has a market cap of £98.2m​ and is currently listed in Canada, said it had received a “positive reception” from UK investors, and two major institutions have become shareholders in the last eight months, reports Lucinda Elliot in London. 

Bacanora’s largest​ mining​ projects are in northern Mexico, with the Sonora lithium project​ consisting of ten mining concessions.

If approved by shareholders​, all existing shares in Bacanora will be exchanged for shares in Bacanora Lithium Plc (Bacanora UK), a new holding company.

Bacanora Minerals’ endorsement of the UK’s Alternative Investment Market​ will no doubt be welcome news to other listed mining companies​ on the exchange​.​ ​Entrants are raising six times more money than they did a decade ago​ with the average size of new companies £76m against £17m in 2006.
