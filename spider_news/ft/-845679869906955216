BoE: ‘Leave’ vote is ‘perhaps global’ risk to markets

2016-06-16

The Bank of England is in no mood to button up about Brexit, with governor Mark Carney earlier today giving a robust defence of the central bank’s place in discussing the topic. No prizes for guessing that it comes up in today’s statement accompanying the decision to keep interest rates on hold, with a heavy hint that the Bank may cut interest rates if the UK votes to leave.

In its statement, the BoE says (highlights ours):

In the weeks since the May Report, an increasing range of financial asset prices has become more sensitive to market perceptions of the likely outcome of the forthcoming EU referendum. On the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling’s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply. This would be consistent with changes to the fundamentals underpinning the exchange rate, including worsening terms of trade, lower productivity, and higher risk premia.

In addition, UK short-term interest rates and measures of UK bank funding costs appear to have been materially influenced by opinion polls about the referendum. These effects have also become evident in non-sterling assets: market contacts attribute much of the deterioration in global risk sentiment to increasing uncertainty ahead of the referendum. The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets. 

It adds:

The most significant risks to the MPC’s forecast concern the referendum. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy.
