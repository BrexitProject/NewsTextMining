Japan’s Aso vows ‘appropriate action’ on yen

2016-06-24

Japan’s finance minister Taro Aso “can take appropriate actions” on the foreign exchange market if needed, he said at a hastily-arranged press conference in Tokyo on Friday, as the yen surged against the dollar on the outcome of the British EU membership referendum.

He did not touch on immediate intervention but said that he will watch closely with a sense of urgency, according to Reuters.

He said he is “very concerned” about the impacts of Britain’s decision to leave the EU on global economic markets, but stressed that Brexit won’t have an immediate impact on Japan’s real economy.
