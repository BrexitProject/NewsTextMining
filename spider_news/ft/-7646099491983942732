2016-06-20

The man charged with murdering Labour MP Jo Cox made no application for bail as he attended his first hearing at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh prison.

Thomas Mair, 52, of Birstall, has been charged with murdering the MP, who was fatally shot and stabbed as she left her constituency surgery in the Yorkshire town on Thursday. He has also been charged with firearms offences and with causing grievous bodily harm.

A bystander who tried to intervene in the attack on Cox was seriously injured.

Asked by Mr Justice Sweeney on Monday to confirm that he was Thomas Mair, Mr Mair answered: “Yes I am.” On Saturday, Mr Mair had given his name at an initial hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ court as “Death to traitors, freedom for Britain”.

Mr Mair was making no bail application, his lawyer, Keith Allen, told the court on Monday. He was remanded in custody.

Judicial procedures used in terrorism cases have been applied. Mr Mair will appear at the Old Bailey again on Thursday for a preliminary hearing in the case.
