Travel groups brace for holiday booking decline

2016-06-24

London-listed travel companies face a decline in holiday bookings following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, putting pressure on an already stressed sector.

Holiday and travel stocks were hit particularly hard following the vote, with double-digit falls versus the FTSE’s 5 per cent slide.

Jeffrey Harwood, analyst at Stifel, “Short term there’s clearly been a shock, and we may well see some effect on bookings out of the UK. The weakness in sterling will clearly form part of that decision.”

The pound plunged to the lowest level in 30 years on Friday, tumbling as much as 13 per cent, as investors took fright at Britain’s decision to leave the EU.

Shares in Tui, the world’s largest tour operator, fell 10 per cent to a record low. Fritz Joussen, the chief executive, said the UK’s decision was “barely conceivable” but added: “We are well prepared and confident that TUI Group as a truly global company will not be significantly affected by the decision.” 

Shares in London-based Thomas Cook fell 14 per cent, hovering just above three-year lows. 

But analysts played down the risks of a longer-term hit on travel companies.

“We don’t see any long-term impact — TUI is domiciled in Germany, for example, and they’re all international companies,” said Mr Harwood.

Friday’s fall comes on the back of a heavy slide in travel stocks following terror attacks across the globe. Thomas Cook last month warned its profits would be lower than guided after a drop in the number of passengers to Turkey. It said the effect of the attacks would be “particularly acute” for months to come. 

Public transport companies also suffered, with shares in FTSE 250 company National Express diving 8 per cent, leaving it just above three-year lows. Stagecoach fell 10 per cent, and Go Ahead, a provider of bus and train travel, also slipped 10 per cent.
