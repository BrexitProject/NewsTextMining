EU referendum campaigns suspended after MP shooting

2016-06-16

Campaigning by ‘Remain’ and ‘Leave’ camps have been suspended after British MP Jo Cox was stabbed on Thursday.

Less than an hour after the news broke, the Britain Stronger In Campaign tweeted: “We are suspending all campaigning for the day. Our thoughts are with Jo Cox and her family”.

The official Leave campaign, Vote Leave, will also suspend its campaign a week before the referendum, according to Boris Johnson.

Mr Johnson, who was out campaigning for the Leave campaign, cancelled his final event of the day, which was scheduled to be in Ipswich.

Mr Johnson posted on Twitter: “My thoughts are with Jo and her family.”

Penny Mordaunt, defence minister, also on the Brexit tour said Ms Cox was “hugely respected”.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: “Utterly shocked by the news of the attack on Jo Cox. The thoughts of the whole Labour Party are with her and her family at this time”.

Sadiq Khan, the London mayor and former Labour MP, said: “Shocked to hear terrible news about brilliant MP and friend Jo Cox. Thinking of her and praying for her and family.”
