Mexico cuts spending further as Brexit upends markets

2016-06-24

Mexico’s federal government announced a fresh round of budget cuts in the wake of the UK’s shock vote leave the EU, but the central bank held off from hiking rates – a move the market had been expecting after the peso touched an all-time high of nearly 19.52 against the dollar overnight.

Luis Videgaray, the finance minister, told a news conference on Friday that the government would slash a further 31.7 bn pesos ($1.7bn) from spending this year, but that the second set of cuts for 2016 would not affect Pemex, the state oil company. He said nearly 92 per cent of the cuts would come from current spending, writes Jude Webber in Mexico City.

“Mexico will respond to this [Brexit] as it has done, strengthening its macroeconomic fundamentals and acting with fiscal responsibility,” Mr Videgaray said.

Mexico has already announced cuts of 132bn pesos for this year plus 175bn in spending cuts for 2017.

Financial authorities – the ministry and the central bank – were following developments in the currency markets closely and “in the event of speculation specifically against the peso that might compromise inflation targets, we will act,” Mr Videgaray added. Analysts expect currency market intervention if needed.

The peso stabilised after its overnight dive and at pixel time was trading at around 18.7 to the dollar.

The central bank will next meet on June 30 to decide whether or not to hike rates. Roberto Del Cueto, a deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico, told the news conference “we will have the opportunity to see with all care what are the effects this measure could have on the different economic variable of our country”.

The bank was standing by to take any action needed to keep inflation in line with expectations. “We’ll act if the circumstances require, in as timely and firm manner as needed,” he said.
