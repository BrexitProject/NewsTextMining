Coco bonds hit after Brexit vote

2016-06-24

Coco bonds, the riskiest class of bank debt, have reacted dramatically to Britain’s exit from the European Union.

A Barclays £1bn bond is down 8.5 per cent. It had risen sharply in the days building up to the vote, writes Thomas Hale, capital markets correspondent 

A Banco Popular coco bond is down 8.2 per cent, while a €1.75bn Deutsche Bank bond is down 6.4 per cent.

Coco bonds convert to equity or are written down when banks take severe losses that weaken their capital position, and often move in tandem with shares. The Euro Stoxx banks index is down 7 per cent.

Bank credit default swaps, which indicate the cost of insuring against defaults on bonds, rose sharply early on Friday. The itraxx senior financials 5-year index was up 35.7 basis points to its highest level since February.

A similar index for subordinated financial debt also rose to its highest level since February, when bank stocks and bonds fell sharply.
