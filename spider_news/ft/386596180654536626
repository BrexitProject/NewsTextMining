US stocks slip as investors brace for Brexit vote

2016-06-17

US equities ticked lower on Friday as investors remained skittish ahead of next week’s Brexit referendum.

Despite a rise in volatility in recent days — the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at its lows on Thursday — the US equity index was poised to cap the week down about 1 per cent.

The muted performance comes ahead of the June 23 referendum, where UK citizens will vote on whether the country should remain part of the European Union. Market strategists warned that a ‘leave’ vote could cause ructions in the financial markets and weigh heavily on the UK’s economy.

Indeed, Goldman Sachs told clients on Friday that a Brexit could cause a 1 to 2 per cent fall in Britain’s economic output over the next 12 to 18 months, “leaving the UK economy flirting with recession”. The New York investment bank added that such a move may also weaken the sterling by 10 per cent in trade-weighted terms over the next half a year.

US stock investors have bid-up defensive stocks, which are favoured for their dividend yields, this week, with telecommunications and utilities posting the best performance of the major S&P 500 sectors. Financials, materials and technology stocks, which are all seen as sensitive to fluctuations in the economy, lagged behind.
