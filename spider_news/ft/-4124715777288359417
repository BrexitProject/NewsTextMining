US trade chief cautious on EU trade deal after Brexit

2016-06-24

President Barack Obama famously warned British voters earlier this year that the UK would be at the “back of the queue” in trade talk with the US should they vote to leave the EU, writes Shawn Donnan in Washington. 

But following an unprecedented “Brexit”, the Obama administration has adopted a decidedly more cautious tone, seemingly weighing the impact on a mooted trade deal with the EU (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) that Mr Obama had hoped to conclude negotiations on before he leaves office.

In a statement on Friday, Mr Obama’s trade tsar, Mike Froman said:

The importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the European Union and the United Kingdom.

The economic and strategic rationale for TTIP remains strong. We are evaluating the impact of the United Kingdom’s decision on TTIP and look forward to continuing our engagement with the European Union and our relations with the United Kingdom.

Mr Froman declined to address the possibility of a US-UK trade agreement being hatched some day. US officials believe any such deal would be years away at best, and before discussing terms with the world’s largest economy, the UK would likely have to first determine the precise terms of its new trading relationship with the EU.
