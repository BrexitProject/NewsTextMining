ECB warns of Brexit risk to eurozone growth

2016-06-16

Growth in the eurozone is at risk from Britain’s EU referendum and host of looming geopolitical risks, the European Central Bank has said.

With just a week before Britain heads to the polls in a potentially momentous vote, the ECB said the bloc’s growth outlook was at risk, after posting a robust 0.6 per cent expansion at the start of the year.

In its latest economic bulletin, the ECB said:

Downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global economy, to the upcoming British referendum on EU membership and to other geopolitical risks.

Other threats to the global economy include a normalisation of interest rates in the US, China’s protracted economic slowdown and a low oil-price environment.

On the political calendar, Spain will be attempting to break its electoral stalemate on June 26, Italy faces a constitutional referendum in October, followed by the US elections in November.

The ECB’s comments on the referendum come as a host of global central banks have all weighed in to raise concerns about Britain’s place in the EU.

The Fed, Bank of Japan and Swiss national bank have warned of the impact of a Brexit in the last 24 hours, having decided to keep their respective monetary policy stance on hold in June.
