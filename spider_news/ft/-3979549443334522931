No one ever said that democracy wasnâ€™t risky

2016-06-17

Sir, Despite the alarmist assertions and high-strung hyperbole used by both Brexiters and Remainers, it is worth noting that the referendum is above all a wonderful celebration of democracy. As such, the referendum should prove salubrious in at least three ways.

First, it will pull the plug on a seemingly endless amount of soothsaying and speculation about the alleged merits and demerits of ever-closer union. Second, a Brexit scenario, which looks ever more likely, will also serve as a great reality check, inasmuch as it will test the validity of hitherto unsubstantiated claims about the far-reaching consequences of leaving the EU. And finally, should Britain really become an economic basket case because of Brexit, it surely will be comforting to know that at least it is not Brussels but the British people themselves who are to blame. After all, who said that democracy is without risk?
