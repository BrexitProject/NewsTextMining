Poland ‘dominated’ by eurozone after Brexit – foreign minister

2016-06-23

With about 10 hours to go before polls close in the UK’s EU referendum, some of Britain’s closest European allies are rallying around the Remain camp.

Poland’s foreign minister is the latest to plead with the UK to stay in, warning his country will be “dominated” by the eurozone after a ‘Brexit’.

“If Britain leaves the European Union, the eurozone will dominate…That is a bad scenario for Poland,” Witold Waszczykowski said on Thursday, Henry Foy reports from Warsaw.

Should the UK leave the bloc, Poland, which has not adopted the single currency and uses its domestic Zloty currency, could find itself on the “margins of Europe”, amid a “two-speed EU”.

Seeking protections for “euro outs” against the 19-strong caucus of eurozone states was one of the key planks of UK prime minister David Cameron’s renegotiation demands from Brussels.

Mr Waszczykowski added:

The eurozone could create separate institutions, a separate budget and then the European Union as a whole will be a façade and the eurozone will dominate.

I am keeping my fingers crossed and praying that the result of the referendum is positive for Europe and for Poland, that Britain remains with us.
