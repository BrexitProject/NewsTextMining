Brexit fall out can be contained – Central bank of central banks

2016-06-24

Following a raft of statements from central banks promising to backstop financial markets after Brexit, the Bank of International Settlements (known as the ‘central bank of central banks’) has said it is confident market jitters can be contained.

In a statement released on Friday, the BIS, which is releasing its annual report this weekend, said:

The outcome of the EU referendum in the United Kingdom has resulted in high volatility in markets. Extensive contingency plans by the private sector and central banks have been put in place to limit disturbances in financial markets.

Stronger capital and liquidity buffers in the private sector have also made financial systems more resilient. Central banks have already communicated that they are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to take the necessary actions to ensure orderly market functioning.

There is likely to be a period of uncertainty and adjustment. The United Kingdom is closely integrated in the global economy, and it hosts one of the world’s most important financial centres.

With good cooperation at a global level, we are confident that uncertainty can be contained and that adjustments proceed as smoothly as possible.
