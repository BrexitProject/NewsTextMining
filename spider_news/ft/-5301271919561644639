Bunds scream higher at open

2016-06-24

Wow.

The safety of Bunds is clearly in demand, with yields on the country’s 10-year debt dropping by 0.259 percentage points to a record low of-0.168 per cent. (Yields fall when prices rise. Prices are now so high that new buyers are guaranteed a nominal loss.)

Arif Husain, head of international fixed income at T. Rowe Price said:

Those who believe Brexit is a UK problem are misunderstanding the impact it will have globally. They’re forgetting the impact that Greece had – and Greece is much smaller than the UK, and not a financial centre.

The vote to leave could result in a global recession. It’s likely that the chances of a global recession have risen above 50%.

For investors, the money was to be made in the run-up to the referendum from all the volatility that was occurring. It will be harder to make money now.

Happy Friday.
