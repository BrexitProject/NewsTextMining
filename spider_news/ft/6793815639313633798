A brand that reassures customers the world over

2016-06-20

Sir, The Brexit debate overlooks the benefits of EU regulations to manufacturers.

We produce specialist paper and advanced materials here and sell all over the world. Customers demand to know the environmental impact and sustainability of our processes and working practices, because consumers today are aware of the effect of their purchasing decisions. We comply with the EU’s regulations and — contrary to popular opinion — this gives us a competitive advantage. Manufacturing can be done cheaper elsewhere but with higher environmental and human costs.

Being part of a huge trading bloc with common industry-leading environmental and working practices reassures customers the world over. Consumers expect their suppliers to comply with best practice as it develops, often led by the EU. The EU brand has value.
