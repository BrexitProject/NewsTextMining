Brexit and the British exporter’s nightmare

2016-06-17

Sir, Professor Alan Sked ( Letters, May 28) has depicted the EU as an empire in decline that will die like the Ottoman, Chinese and Moghul empires. Empires born out of war and conquest are very different from a voluntary union of democratic countries that other countries are chomping at the bit to join. Far from dying, the EU it is growing out of childhood into maturity.

Elsewhere, Professor Patrick Minford, in stating that we could negotiate a free-trade agreement with China, has skated over the fact that much of what we produce and export contains imported contents, and that unless we negotiate the same terms with China as the EU has, our added-value products would be subject to EU tariffs. Every exporter that uses imported content in any product from anywhere except the EU will encounter the same problem. In addition, specialist staff will have to be trained to deal with all the implications, the form-filling and compliance.

I write as someone who worked from shop floor to director in a medium-sized manufacturing wholesaler/exporter that won the Queens’s Award for export achievement when I was export director. I can well remember the bureaucracy and specialised forms that companies were required to fill in order to trade, not only with the EEC as the EU was known in the 1960s and 1970s, but also for export to the European Free Trade Association countries: carnets, customs officials often making checks at the behest of other countries, checking on whether we had complied with import/export regulation. Brexit would return exporters to this nightmarish scenario.

Brexit will add substantial costs and add impediments for most companies. Vote Remain.
