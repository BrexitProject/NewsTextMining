Support for ‘Remain’ in EU vote keeps pound at 2016 high

2016-06-23

The British pound was trading at its highest point of 2016 in Asia hours out before UK voters choose whether to remain or leave the European Union.

Sterling received a boost overnight after two surveys showed the Remain camp with a slight edge over those leave the EU. The currency gained as much as 0.9 per cent in morning trade in Asia on Thursday to $1.4844, consolidating an overnight gain of 0.4 per cent, writes Peter Wells. That is its highest intraday level since December 31 2015.

Late on Wednesday, a poll from ComRes showed 48 per cent of those surveyed would stay in the Union, versus 42 per cent who would vote to leave. And 51 per cent of respondents in a YouGov survey would vote to stay, compared to 49 per cent in the Leave camp.

Ray Attrill, global co-head of FX Strategy at National Australia Bank noted the most recent “poll of polls” suggesting the two camps running neck-and-neck.

“We’d note though with ‘undecideds’ still in excess of 10 per cent, the final result could well end up being much more decisive than this. In the 2014 Scottish referendum, most of the ‘undecideds’ turned out in favour of the status quo,” he said.

“Even though it looks as though much of the ‘risk of ‘Brexit’ has been priced out markets (e.g. the British Pound is now stronger than it was the day before the referendum date was announced) there remains plenty of scope for volatility on either outcome, albeit (very) much more on a Leave’ than ‘Remain’ outcome,” Mr Attrill added.

The currency had moderated to $1.4813 at 09.01am Hong Kong time, but enough to leave it trading half of one per cent higher for the year. January 4 was the last time the pound had closed positive year-to-date.

The pound was stronger against other global currencies today. The yen was worst off, down 1.2 per cent against sterling, while the Australian dollar and euro were both weaker by 0.5 per cent.
