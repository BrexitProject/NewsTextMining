Fast Europe Open: Should I stay or should I go?

2016-06-23

So come on and let me know.

At last – at last – it is June 23, the day of the UK’s referendum on EU membership.

For all your Brexit/Bremain needs, do check out the FT’s EU referendum landing page here, and note the FT will also be running a live blog today and into the wee hours of Friday morning (UK time) when the results are expected.

The lead from Asian markets looks good positive today, and while you were sleeping, the pound hit its highest level of the year.

Sterling is 0.6 per cent higher at $1.4795, but had gained as much as 0.9 per cent to $1.4844 early in the Asian session. That puts it up about 0.5 per cent against the dollar this year.

Japan’s Topix is up 0.8 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is up 0.2 per cent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 has gained 0.2 per cent. Chinese shares are down by 0.8 per cent.

On referendum day, the FTSE 100 is tipped to rise 37 points, according to IG Markets, while Germany’s Dax is set to add 59 points and France’s Cac 40 should gain 25 points.

A lot of things might seem like a sideshow compared to the UK’s referendum, but here are the highlights of the earnings and economic calendar (London time):
