Gilts flop in early trading as nerves subside

2016-06-20

Phew.

UK government bonds, which have screamed higher in recent days on fears that the UK will vote to leave the EU, are backing down today, in line with signs that the Remain campaign is regaining some momentum in an extremely tight race.

Yields on the UK’s 10-year government bonds now stand at a relatively lofty 1.192 per cent, up by 0.05 percentage points on the (young) day so far.

Last week, they dipped as low as 1.111 per cent. (Yields fall when prices rise, and higher prices for these bolt-hole investments in this case show nerves that a vote to leave the EU could prompt a recession and interest rate cuts.)

Cooler demand for gilts coincides with a hefty rally for sterling, again driven by the latest opinion polls.

This may, however, prove to be misplaced confidence.

“They think it’s all over. It isn’t, yet,” said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale in London.

“The market will surely gyrate some more in the next few days as any shift in that position triggers an exaggerated reaction, not just for sterling but for wider risk sentiment.”
