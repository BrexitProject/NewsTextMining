Investors bolster defences against European bond sell-off

2016-06-17

Trading activity in products that protect against falls in European corporate bond prices jumped above $50bn for the first time since March this week in a sign of rising investor angst ahead of the Brexit referendum next week.

Volume on the Markit iTraxx Europe index, which tracks credit default swaps that rise in value as European corporate debt prices fall, rose to $54.4bn this week, according to Bloomberg data compiled at mid-day in New York. That is the highest level since the week of March 25, writes Adam Samson in New York.

The price of the iTraxx index , which is often used by investors to protect against European market risk, also rose on Tuesday to its highest level since early March, although the cost had receded somewhat by the end of the week.

The increased activity in the European CDS market is one of several signs in recent days of concern over the June 23 vote by UK citizens on whether the country should remain a member of the European Union.

Indeed, data released on Thursday showed that UK equity funds faced redemptions of $1.1bn in the week to June 15, the second-sharpest outflow on record.

“Markets are tense going into the EU referendum next week,” Morgan Stanley’s currencies team noted.
