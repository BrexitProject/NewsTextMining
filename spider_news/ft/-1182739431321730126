Toyota: Free access to European market ‘critical’

2016-06-20

Toyota has given the clearest indication yet it will lay off jobs at its UK plants if Britain votes to leave the EU.

On a day when the UK’s motor industry has joined forces to warn of the impact of a potential “Brexit”, Japan’s largest car maker issued a stark warning to staff, writes Peter Campbell, motor industry correspondent.

The company said it would face “huge cost reduction challenges” at its plants in Burnaston in Derbyshire and Deeside in north Wales if the UK faced tariffs on exports to Europe.

The sites employ just over 4,000 staff currently, and earlier this year Toyota announced a £7m investment into the Deeside plant. Three quarters of the cars from the plants are exported to the EU.

Its letter to staff, which was co-signed by the Unite Union, say “open and free access to the European Market is of critical importance to our UK manufacturing business.”

It reads:

If the UK leaves the EU we think it unlikely the UK can keep the current arrangement of no tariffs or duties; this would mean we would have to pay duties on parts and cars.

This could be as much as 10 per cent for cars, which would lead to either huge cost reduction challenges for us or more expensive cars for our customers, with a negative impact on our sales.

It goes on:

Toyota is committed to its factories and people in the UK as we are to our operations anywhere in the world

The letter adds that anything that “adds to the cost and complexity of building cars, parts or engines here will make it harder for us to compete and win new business”.

Toyota said the letter has been distributed to “avoid confusion” after an earlier pledge to stay in the UK was paraded by the Brexit campaign on its literature. Toyota said it was considering legal action following the move by the Leave campaign.
