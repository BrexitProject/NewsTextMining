Liquidity support ready after Brexit –  India’s Rajan

2016-06-24

India’s central bank is ready to provide liquidity support and any other necessary steps to keep the market in orderly conditions, Governor Raghuram Rajan said Friday.

UK’s decision to leave the EU has led to heavy selling of the Indian rupee along with other currencies across Asia. The Swiss National Bank has become the first major central bank to intervene in the currency markets this morning. 

The rupee fell as much as Rs68.27 per dollar in Friday’s trading, down 1.5 per cent from its previous closing, extending losses that had piled since Rajan announced his departure as the central bank head earlier this month.

It is now trading at around Rs67.96 per dollar.

The Reserve Bank of India is “continuously maintaining a close vigil on the market developments, both domestically and internationally,” Rajan said in a statement released Friday.

“The Indian economy has good fundamentals, low short term external debt, and sizeable foreign reserves. These should stand the country in good stead in the days to come,” he added.
