Uneasy calm takes hold ahead of UK vote

2016-06-21

Tuesday 21:00 BST. An uneasy calm settled over global markets following the previous session’s sharp moves as the countdown to the UK’s referendum on EU membership remained the key driver of sentiment.

The overriding focus on the vote meant that the normally keenly watched semi-annual testimony to congress by Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, attracted less attention than usual.

Sterling had a much steadier session after starting the week with its best one-day showing against the dollar for nearly eight years as opinion polls showed the Leave campaign in the vote losing momentum. 

The latest polls pointed to a neck-and-neck race — although bookmakers’ odds continued to favour the Remain camp. 

“Betting markets’ implied chance of a Brexit has dipped to 25 per cent from 40 per cent last week,” said Oliver Jones at Capital Economics. “In other words, betting markets consider a Remain vote three times as likely.” 

Global equities continued to regain some of the ground lost over the past couple of weeks — albeit at a gentler pace than on Monday — in spite of a retreat for oil prices. Moves in government bond markets were muted while gold stood out as it tumbled to a 10-day low.

Much of the day’s focus was on the pound, particularly after George Soros, the international investor, warned that the currency could take a bigger hit in the event of a Brexit than it did on “Black Wednesday” in September 1992.

But sterling held the bulk of Monday’s big advance against the dollar, slipping 0.4 per cent to $1.4637 after touching $1.4781 in early trade. Just last Thursday, the UK currency came within a whisker of sliding below the $1.40 level.

Meanwhile, the pound rose a further 0.1 per cent against the euro to €1.3001 and another 0.5 per cent against the yen to ¥153.43.

UK equities also built on the previous day’s rise as the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent — giving it a gain over the past three days of 4.6 per cent. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.7 per cent to a 10-day high, led by another round of strong gains for financial stocks.

Trading was more choppy on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 ended 0.3 per cent higher at 2,088 after swinging between 2,083.02 and 2,093.66. The CBOE Vix volatility index was up 0.8 per cent in late trade at 18.52.

Weaker energy stocks held back the S&P as oil prices spent most of the day in negative territory. But a late rally saw Brent crude settle less than 0.1 per cent lower at $50.62 a barrel.

Japanese stocks were buoyed by a weaker yen as the general mood in the market turned less risk averse. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 per cent as the dollar gained 0.8 per cent against the Japanese currency to ¥104.75.

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of peers, was up 0.5 per cent — bolstered mostly by a 0.5 per cent decline for euro to $1.1254 — even as Ms Yellen reiterated her cautious stance on the outlook for US monetary policy.

The Fed chair said she saw “considerable uncertainty” about the US economic outlook, highlighting weaker jobs numbers and soft investment as some of the risks on the horizon.

Her remarks were viewed by many as consistent with the view that a July interest rate rise looked unlikely.

Philip Marey, senior US strategist at Rabobank, said: “For now, the Federal Open Market Committee still expects the headwinds, which include economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation and meagre productivity growth, to slowly fade over time. 

“Thus gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be needed. While today’s testimony by the Fed chair supports our view of a September hike — assuming that employment growth will pick up in the coming months — the risk to our expectation of two hikes before the end of the year, the second in December, is still to the downside.”

US Treasury prices eased after Ms Yellen’s remarks — although this also reflected a continuation of the “risk-off” moves seen in the markets on Monday. 

The yield on the 10-year note was up 3 basis points at 1.70 per cent while the more policy-sensitive two-year yield was 2bp higher at 0.76 per cent. 

The 10-year German Bund yield slipped 1bp to 0.05 per cent, just three days after touching a record low of minus 0.038 per cent — while that on the 10-year UK gilt jumped another 5bp to 1.29 per cent, leaving it a hefty 22bp up from the record low it reached last Thursday. 

The firmer dollar and higher US bond yields weighed on gold, with the metal sliding $24 to $1,265 an ounce, the lowest since June 10.
