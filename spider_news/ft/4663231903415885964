CBI on Brexit: ‘We need strong & calm leadership’

2016-06-24

As Europe wakes up to the news that Britain has voted to leave the EU, reactions from the UK’s leading business groups have started to pour in.

The Institute of Directors admits that the referendum result may not have been the one most of its members wanted but now that the UK has decided, it is “imperative” that political leaders manage the transition out of Europe “as smoothly as possible”, it says. imon Walker, head of the IoD (highlights ours), said:

British businesses are resilient and, with their characteristic ingenuity, they will weather this storm. It is now beholden on politicians to negotiate a deal with European leaders which preserves the ability of British firms to trade easily with the remaining member states. Even once we have left, the EU will continue to be our biggest trading partner, and the first destination for many companies when they start to export. One thing the Government must do immediately is to guarantee the right to remain of EU citizens currently in the UK. Companies do not want to have to worry about losing valued staff.

Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, says the urgent priority now is to reassure markets. She said:

We need strong and calm leadership from the Government, working with the Bank of England, to shore up confidence and stability in the economy.

The choices we make over the coming months will affect generations to come. This is not a time for rushed decisions.
