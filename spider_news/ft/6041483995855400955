Cost to hedge against UK market risk eases

2016-06-20

UK creditworthiness, as judged by investors, has been given a shot in the arm by Brexit referendum polls.

The cost to insure the UK against default fell 6 basis points on Monday – the largest one day move since the depths of the eurozone crisis – as polls on the EU referendum showed the two camps running neck and neck, writes Elaine Moore.

UK CDS rose sharply last week after it was reported that the Leave campaign had edged in front of Remain for the first time but fell back on Monday from 41 basis points to 35 basis points – or $35,000 to insure $1m of government debt annually for five years, according to data provider Markit.

While few investors expect the UK to renege on its debt, the derivative contracts exist as a way for traders to express an opinion on UK creditworthiness and to hedge against market risk more broadly.

All three of the world’s largest credit rating agencies have warned that a vote to Leave would have a negative impact on the UK’s credit score, with S&P warning that the UK could lose its final AAA rating.

Fitch, which cut its rating on the UK to a notch below AAA level in 2013, said that leaving the EU would bring short-term disruption and long-term risks.
