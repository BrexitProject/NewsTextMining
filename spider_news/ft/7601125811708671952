FTSE 100 wipes out last week’s declines

2016-06-20

It’s neck-and-next in the Brexit polls, but that’s enough for a breakneck rally for London stocks, and continental bourses are also picking up speed.

Sentiment across global markets has picked up after the Remain campaign’s improved showing in the opinion polls and as the odds on it winning the UK’s referendum on EU membership on Thursday, writes Michael Hunter.

London’s FTSE 100 is up 104 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 6,141.63, wiping out all of the declines it made over the last trading week. Financial, consumer and housebuilding stocks are leading the rally. Royal Bank of Scotland is the top stock, up 5.7 per cent. Lloyds Banking Group is just behind, up 5.1 per cent. The FTSE 250, seen as more representative of the domestic UK economy, is up 1.5 per cent.

Sterling is up 1.4 per cent at $1.4557, making it the best-performing major global currency. It reached as high as $1.4623 during the Asian session. Against the euro, the pound strengthened by 1 per cent, with £0.7780 required for a unit of the shared currency.

On the continent, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax 30 is up 0.9 per cent, while the CAC 40 in Paris is up 1 per cent.

Brexit concerns are likely to stay front and centre for investors in the run-up to the vote. Previous polls showed the Leave campaign gaining an edge over Remain, undermining the pound, pushing yields on UK gilts to record lows and spurring volatility across financial markets. Last week marked the second-largest outflow from UK funds over the past decade, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

But on Monday, the yield on 10-year German Bunds, which moves inversely to prices, fell 2 basis points to 0.04 per cent as investors moved away from haven assets. The yield on the UK’s 10-year Gilt fell 5 basis points to 1.19 per cent.Asian shares are also pushing higher, with Japanese exporters aided by a weaker yen, as demand for haven currencies faded in line with the improvement to sentiment.

Japan’s currency is slipping by 0.4 per cent to ¥‎104.6 per dollar, putting it on track to halt a six-session winning streak. That boosted the Japanese equities market, particularly currency-sensitive exporters, with the broad Topix and the Nikkei 225 each up 2.3 per cent and heading for their best gains in two months.

In Hong Kong the Hang Seng is up 1.4 per cent, while in mainland China the Shanghai Composite is down 0.3 per cent.

Indian stocks dipped and the rupee fell in response to news that Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, will not be staying on when his three-year term ends on September 4.
