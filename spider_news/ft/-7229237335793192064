BofA Merrill to staff: ‘avoid distraction’ after Brexit shock

2016-06-24

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has told staff to “avoid distraction” and focus on clients and not the bank as the shock Brexit outcome ricochets around financial markets.

The comments were made by BAML’s EMEA president Alex Wilmot-Sitwell in a message to UK staff this morning, writes Laura Noonan.

Mr Wilmot-Sitwell said the merger of BofA and Merrill Lynch made him “very confident” BAML could successfully execute a plan to protect its European business before the UK’s exit of the EU comes into effect.

“Our immediate focus however must not be on ourselves but on ensuring that we are squarely behind our clients during these unprecedented times,” he said.

He added that the bank must “avoid distraction”:

Please make sure that our clients know that we are all committed to guiding them through the challenges ahead and that we will do everything we can to make their journey as seamless as possible,” he said. “That means that, starting today, it is business as usual.

BAML, like several US banks, uses London as a base to sell products into the EU – a situation that might not be possible under the terms of the UK’s EU exit.
