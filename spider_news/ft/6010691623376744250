Pound trims gain in wake of Opinium poll

2016-06-22

The pound pared its advance Wednesday after the ‘leave’ camp took a slight edge off ‘remain’ in the latest poll ahead of the Brexit referendum.

The online survey by Opinium, conducted from June 20 – 22, showed support for leave increasing by one percentage point to 45 per cent, while remain held steady at 44 per cent.

Sterling, which is extremely sensitive to even modest fluctuations in the perceived chances that UK voters will favour leaving the European Union, was up by 0.15 per cent following the news. It had been up about 0.47 per cent ahead of the poll.
