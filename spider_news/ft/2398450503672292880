Brexit could cost German economy dear – Ifo institute

2016-06-16

Brexit represents the “biggest risk” facing the German economy, a leading German economic institute has said.

Ifo group has raised its 2016 forecast for German growth to 1.8 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in the spring, saying the economy was doing well. But it warned that the prediction was based on the assumption that the UK would remain in the EU, writes Stefan Wagstyl.

“The biggest risk is Brexit,” said Clemens Fuest, Ifo’s president.

He said that in the worst case, Brexit could cost Germany up to 3 per cent of GDP due to the impact on trade, investment and competitiveness.

Meanwhile, Germany is profiting from low energy costs, low interest rates and solid domestic demand. Said Timo Wollmershäuser, Ifo’s economic research chief:

The first quarter went better than expected. The moderate upswing sustained since 2014 is going into its second half.
