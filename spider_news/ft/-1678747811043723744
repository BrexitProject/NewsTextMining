Tusk: ‘we will keep our unity as a 27 member bloc’

2016-06-24

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council has warned EU leaders are “determined to keep our unity as a 27″ after the UK’s exit.

He said there would be “no legal vacuum” until the UK formally applies to leave the EU by triggering Article 50, which sets a two-year deadline for divorce, adding that all EU law would continue to apply to the UK.

Mr Tusk said: “there is no hiding the fact we wanted a different outcome”.

“This is a historic moment but not a moment for hysterical reactions”.

“I am fully aware of how dramatic this event is. There is no way of predicting the political consequences of this event”, said the former Polish prime minister.

Mr Tusk has now offered for the remaining 27 leaders to meet ahead of a full meeting of the European Council next week on June 28-29.

The EU institutions will also release a joint statement in reaction to the referendum later today, he said.

A host of senior European politicians have been commenting on today’s results.

In Germany, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said it was “a sad day for Europe.”

He is meeting EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Friday to discuss the results and on Saturday hosting a gathering in Berlin of the foreign minsters of of the EU’s six founding members – Germany, France, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Italy and Belgium.

Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian foreign minister, tweeted: “Brexit is a political earthquake for Europe. Europe needs swift changes to become more than just the EU minus Great Britain.”
