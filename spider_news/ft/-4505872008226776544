Not over yet: Sterling pulls back sharply

2016-06-23

As if to remind us that itâ€™s not over until every vote is counted, sterling has stumbled.

Earlier, the pound hit $1.50 after polls conducted today indicated that Remain will win the day. It has since pulled back to $1.4819 in a dip that started following reports that the result for Newcastle would be fine. Indeed, it ended up producing a very narrow win for Remain.
