Currency sales in UK surge ahead of Brexit vote

2016-06-22

With opinion polls suggesting a tight result, British holidaymakers are clearly taking no chances a day ahead of the UK’s EU membership referendum.

The Post Office has reported a surge in foreign currency sales with less than 24 hours to go before Britain’s EU membership referendum, as economists – and the Bank of England – have warned that a vote to quit the EU could trigger a sharp plunge in the value of the pound,writes Nathalie Thomas.

Online sales of foreign currency were up 381 per cent on Tuesday compared to the same date a year ago, a spokeswoman for the Post Office said, while sales in its branches were also up by nearly 49 per cent.

Overall, currency sales were up 74-per cent year-on-year yesterday, said the Post Office, which accounts for one-in-four of all UK foreign exchange transactions. Britons have been taking advantage of a rally in sterling over the last few days to get more favourable rates on their holiday money.

The latest opinion polls suggest that the “remain” camp has regained ground after “leave” edged ahead last week but the FT’s poll of polls suggests the result could be difficult to call. Betting odds – which often vary wildly from opinion polls – have Remain ahead.

Sterling is up 0.22 per cent against the dollar to $1.4684 today, having staged a 2.37 per cent surge on Monday against the greenback – the pound’s biggest one-day gain in eight years – as opinion polls and betting odds began to show “remain” had regained some momentum. Against the euro, the pound is broadly flat on the day, with one pound buying 1.3020 euros.

The Bank of England’s rate-setting committee has warned a vote to leave could send the pound tumbling.
