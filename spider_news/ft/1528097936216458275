Sterling steadies; derivatives still show stress

2016-06-17

The pound is holding steady early in European trading, holding onto yesterday’s modest gains. But the nerves are of course still there, with short-term options that capture likely moves in the pound over the next week leaping higher.

The tragedy-affected suspension of campaigning for next week’s referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union has, grimly, given sterling a boost. It now trades at $1.4240, up by 1.5 per cent from the week’s low.

Writes Commerzbank:

The tragic murder of a British MP yesterday does not cause the FX market to stop and mourn, but instead leads to the consequences being priced in in a cool and matter of fact way. We as commentators of the FX market have no choice but to follow this approach.

As the bank says, referendum risks are now most visible through the options market, as the chart above (from Bloomberg) shows. One-week sterling volatility – a measure of expected market moves and the cost of hedging against a sterling shakeout with a horizon to the end of next week, is at a record high of 49.51 per cent, well beyond levels observed in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum and the 2008 crisis.

UK government bonds are also edging back after their record-breaking rally. Ten-year Gilt yields now stand at 1.14 per cent – still tiny by any historical measure, but above the low of 1.111 per cent seen earlier in the week. Low yields reflect high prices.
