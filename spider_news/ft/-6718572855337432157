Global central banks join chorus of Brexit concern

2016-06-16

First, to the fury of Leave campaigners, it was the Bank of England. But now a premium list of top-flight central banks is expressing nerves around the potential outcome of the UK’s referendum on EU membership.

Overnight, the US Federal Reserve cited next week’s vote as a potential risk to the global economic outlook while a European Central Bank official said it stood ready to step in to help liquidity if the vote mucks up markets.

Today, as the part of the world facing the biggest risk to growth, after a Brexit, the ECB repeated its concerns about downside risks to European growth from the referendum. 

It came after the Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda said his central bank is in “close communication” with global peers over the vote, which he says has contributed to the collapse in Japanese government bond yields.

And now the Swiss National Bank has also today said the vote could be unsettling.

So much for expectations that the vote would be a uniquely British problem, on which, more here.
