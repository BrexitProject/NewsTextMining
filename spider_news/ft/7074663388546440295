FTSE 100 slumps 7.4% after Brexit vote

2016-06-24

The FTSE 100 has slumped 7.4 per cent this morning in the wake of the UKâ€™s vote to leave the EU.

Taylor Wimpey was the biggest faller, sliding 42 per cent, while RBS skidded 34 per cent and IAG slid 33.7 per cent.

This is the latest sign of extreme market pressure in the wake of the referendum vote.

Sterling has slumped 10 per cent against the dollar, its worst one-day drop on record, while the euro is also suffering its worst one-day decline on record.

Deutsche Bank and HSBC have both predicted further heavy falls for sterling.

The FTSE 100 had rallied 8.2 per cent in the five sessions leading up to the referendum, as confidence built that the UK would vote to remain.
