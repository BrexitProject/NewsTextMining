JPMorgan saw record overnight FX activity – Dimon

2016-06-24

Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, has paid tribute to his staff’s round-the-clock efforts during a night of frenetic trading driven by the UK’s decision to exit the EU.

In an internal memo on Friday, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, noted that overnight foreign-exchange activity on the bank’s e-trading channels peaked at a record 1,000 trading tickets per second. FX volumes around the world on Friday were expected to be three times the normal daily level, he said, reports Ben McLannahan in New York.

“In dramatic times like these, the quality, scope, capabilities and character of JPMorgan Chase truly come into focus,” he wrote. “We are here to be a source of strength for our clients, communities, governments and markets. Let’s keep up the great work.”

Shares in the bank – which has around 16,000 employees in the UK – dropped almost 7 per cent Friday, slightly worse than the US financials sector.

Mr Dimon had shared a stage with George Osborne, the UK chancellor, earlier this month, warning that Brexit could prompt the bank to move up to 4,000 jobs from the UK.

“It’s a terrible deal for the British economy and jobs,” Mr Dimon told staff and reporters at a JPMorgan office in Bournemouth, on the south coast. “I don’t want you to worry about it but when you vote you should think about something like that. Please think really carefully about this decision.”
