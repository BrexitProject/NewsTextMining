Munich Re warns UK will lose influence to other financial hubs

2016-06-24

Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance group, has warned that Brexit will have detrimental economic consequences for the UK that will see it lose its influence as a financial centre to other global finance hubs.

The German group’s chief economist, Michael Menhart, described the decision as a “major blow for the EU” and said that it would have “severe economic implications” particularly for the UK, but also for the EU, writes James Shotter in Frankfurt.

He forecast that the decision would knock 1 percentage point off UK growth this year and next, and will exert a smaller impact on the EU.

“London will lose influence as a financial centre to hubs such as Singapore or New York,” Mr Menhart added.
