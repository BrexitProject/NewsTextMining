Gilt yields clock biggest drop since 2009

2016-06-24

The 10-year Gilt yield has dropped to a new record this morning as investors flock to haven assets in the wake of the Brexit vote, which has sent shockwaves through global markets.

 10-year Gilt yields have plunged 28 basis points (or 0.28 percentage points), the biggest one-day decline since March 2009, touching a new all-time low of 1.02 per cent.

Yesterday Gilts prices fell as confidence built the UK would vote to remain in the EU, and yields climbed as high as 1.40 per cent.
