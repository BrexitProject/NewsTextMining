Fast Europe Open: Going through withdrawal

2016-06-17

As the Brexit referendum nears, investors have begun voting with their wallets, hitting UK stock funds with their worst withdrawals in more than a year.

Funds invested in UK equities recorded $1.1bn of redemptions in the week to June 15, the eighth consecutive week of outflows from the asset class, while British bond funds counted their first withdrawals since the start of May, according to flows tracked by EPFR.

Nearly $3bn has been pulled from UK stock portfolios over the past eight weeks as the Leave campaign gained ground. Four-fifths of surveys released over the past week gave the Leave camp an edge in the June 23 referendum, with Remain trailing 43 per cent to 48 per cent, an FT poll of polls showed.

At lunchtime markets had drummed up some positive momentum ahead of European trading: the Hang Seng was up 0.75 per cent, the Nikkei was up 1.32 per cent and the ASX 200 was up 0.34 per cent. The Shanghai Composite was up 0.69 per cent, while the Shenzhen Composite was up 1.05 per cent.
