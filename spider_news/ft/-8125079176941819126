Risk appetite boosted by UK opinion polls

2016-06-20

Monday 21:00 BST. Risk appetite returned with a vengeance to global markets as the latest opinion polls on the UK referendum on European Union membership showed that momentum for the Leave campaign had stalled.

US and European stocks recouped all of last week’s Brexit-fuelled losses, emerging market equities and currencies rallied, while Brent oil climbed back above the $50 a barrel mark. 

“Core” government bond prices fell and those in the eurozone “periphery” rose, while gold and the yen lost ground.

Sterling was on track for its best day against the dollar for more than seven years as it leapt more than 2 per cent to briefly regain the $1.47 level.

“Financial markets moved to aggressively price out Brexit risk on Monday,” said Nick Kounis, head of macro research at ABN Amro.

“Most asset classes have tracked the shifts in Brexit risk over the past few weeks — not only UK assets, but also in Europe and globally. So it was no surprise that the decline in the Brexit odds went hand in hand with a significant shift in markets.”

Oliver Jones at Capital Economics noted that the latest opinion polls had shown a slim lead for Remain, in contrast to six polls released last week that had shown Leave ahead, one by as much as 10 percentage points.

“Reflecting the shifting polls, betting markets’ implied probability of a vote to leave the EU has slipped from close to 40 per cent in the middle of last week to just 28 per cent on Monday,” Mr Jones said.

But Mr Kounis at ABN Amro highlighted that with sterling/dollar close to $1.47, it was not far off its high for the year, and argued that “very little Brexit risk premium” was being priced in.

“Given that the polls are still close and that uncertainty on the outcome is still high, it therefore looks as if markets have now become a little complacent about Brexit risk,” he said. “This obviously sets the scene for much sharper movements in case of a Leave vote, if markets hold on to these levels.”

Aside from sterling’s huge gain — it was last trading at $1.4691, up 2.3 per cent on the day — soaring equity markets in both the UK and continental Europe offered perhaps the most palpable signs of relief about the opinion polls, with financial stocks enjoying the best of the gains.

London’s FTSE 100 index rose more than 3 per cent for its biggest one-day gain since February, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 climbed 3.7 per cent to its highest level in more than a week.

Across the Atlantic, the S&P 500 trimmed an early rise that had taken it back above the 2,100 level, but still ended 0.6 firmer at 2,083. The gain left it 1.8 per cent short of the 2016 intraday high struck on June 8.

The CBOE Vix volatility index was down 5 per cent in late trade at 18.44, after having touched 22.89 at one point last week, the highest for nearly four months and well above its long-term average of 20.

Meanwhile, MSCI’s emerging market equity index jumped 1.9 per cent, the most in more than two months, while its EM currency Index gained 0.8 per cent.

The dollar fell 1.9 per cent against the South African rand, 0.9 per cent versus the Russian rouble and 0.5 per cent against the Brazilian real.

One exception was the Indian rupee, which was 0.7 per cent softer against the dollar following news that Raghuram Rajan would step down as governor of the Reserve Bank of India in September.

Sterling’s strong rally versus the US currency — plus a 0.3 per cent rise for the euro to $1.1303 — helped drive the dollar index down 0.5 per cent. 

Dollar/yen reversed an early gain to stand 0.2 per cent lower at ¥103.89, but the euro was up 0.1 per cent versus the Japanese currency at ¥117.43 and the pound was up 2.1 per cent at ¥152.60.

The improvement in risk appetite was also apparent in the government bond markets.

The yield on the 10-year UK gilt, which moves inversely to its price, rose 10 basis points to 1.24 per cent, while that on the equivalent-maturity German Bund, which slipped into negative territory last week as Brexit worries intensified, rose 4bp to 0.06 per cent.

The 10-year US Treasury yield was 6bp higher at 1.67 per cent, just two days after hitting 1.56 per cent, the lowest for nearly four years.

Among eurozone “peripheral” sovereigns, Italy’s 10-year yield fell 8bp to 1.37 per cent and Portugal’s shed 15bp to 3.16 per cent.

As well as financials, energy stocks had a positive session as Brent oil rose 3 per cent to settle at $50.65 a barrel, for a two-day gain of more than 7 per cent.

“The sharp rebound in the oil price during the last two days is a good indication of the solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50 a barrel,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB.

Despite the softer dollar, gold was down $7 at $1,290 an ounce.
