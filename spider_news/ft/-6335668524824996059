Deutsche predicts 15% further fall for sterling

2016-06-24

Sterling has plunged since the UK voted to leave the EU, but Deutsche Bank warns we haven’t seen the worst of it yet.

The pound has already slumped 10 per cent against the dollar today, its worst one-day drop ever, but Deutsche predicts it could fall a further 15 per cent to $1.15.

That’s 23 per cent below its pre-Brexit level.

It warns:

The UK’s record current account deficit means the currency is the in the worst possible position for the severe slowdown in capital inflows that will result from uncertainty generated by the result today.

This will be exacerbated by further Bank of England easing, as forecast by our UK chief economist, and a sharp slowdown in growth.
