Brexit opportunities will exist with oil

2016-06-21

Activity is thinning, some trading platforms are preparing to extend their hours and London-based bankers are in line to pull all-nighters. 

Even UK spread betting groups are increasing initial margins significantly across a swath of products. 

Some may think it overblown but the market clearly is treating the UK referendum on Thursday as a big binary risk event.

But, from a purely speculative standpoint, such occasions tend to deliver opportunities as asset classes lurch in lockstep.

And given the bookies still tend to favour a Remain vote, the greater reaction should be delivered by a Brexit, providing mispriced “risk off” moves.

Take the oil price. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, says: “In the event of a Brexit, we expect Brent to sell down to between $40/b and $45/b, which would be a great buying opportunity.” 

Recent action suggests “solid appetite for buying oil whenever it drops below $50/b . . . While overall sentiment in financial markets could be depressed for quite some time, the supply/demand balance for oil would not be impacted very much.”

Trading Post notes that oil may also get support from a falling dollar should the Federal Reserve be seen holding off from interest rate rises amid Brexit funk.

This also means any initial risk off-induced retreat for emerging market currencies may be curtailed, or even reversed by the ultimately weaker greenback.
