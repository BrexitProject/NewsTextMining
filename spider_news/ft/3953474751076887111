Swiss National bank intervenes in currency markets

2016-06-24

Switzerland has wasted no time to respond to Brexit.

The Swiss National Bank has intervened in the currency markets on Friday morning, write Roger Blitz and Ralph Atkins.

It said in a statement:

Following the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, the Swiss franc came under upward pressure. The Swiss National Bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilise the situation and will remain active in that market.

The Swiss franc was up 1.4 per cent on the euro and by 6.6 per cent on sterling.

By announcing publicly that it had intervened in foreign exchange markets, the SNB will hope to demonstrate its determination to prevent a steep rise in the franc hitting Swiss exporters.

Today’s statement is only the second time the SNB has officially confirmed intervention to weaken the Swiss franc since January 2015 when it abandoned its cap on the currency’s value against the euro. The previous occasion was in late June last year, when Greece unexpectedly announced a referendum on its bail-out by European partners.

Since mid-2013, the SNB has had a fully operational branch in Singapore, which allowed it to intervene from the start of Asian trading and as the UK referendum result became clearer.
