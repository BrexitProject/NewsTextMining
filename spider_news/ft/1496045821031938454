Brexit poll puts Leave 45%, Remain 42% – Survation/IG

2016-06-16

Britain’s anti-EU ‘Leave’ campaign has increased its lead by seven points, rushing ahead of its rivals to 45 per cent according to a poll by Survation and IG.

With just a week before the referendum, the Leave camp increased its lead from 38 per cent, with Remain falling two points to 42 per cent, in a phone survey from the company carried out on June 15.

It is the first time the Brexit camp has been in front since the polling began from Survation in February.

“Leave’s” seven-point spurt appears to show that they’re swaying undecided voters”, said the polling companies.

It is the latest poll showing a healthy lead for Brexit, after Ipsos Mori gave ‘Leave’ an eight point lead over its rival at 53 per cent versus 47 per cent on Thursday.

Sterling fell to $1.411 against the dollar following the release, which came at the same time as a warning from the Bank of England that Brexit was a “global risk” for markets.
