US stocks tick up as Brexit vote looms large

2016-06-22

US equities kicked off Wednesday slightly higher, with investors reluctant to make bets ahead of the looming UK referendum.

The S&P 500 climbed on Monday and Tuesday, as polls showed the “remain” camp closing the gap with the “leave” group ahead of Thursday’s vote on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union. However, the risk rally lost some of its momentum on Wednesday, with the pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 ticking up by about 0.5 per cent.

Market strategists said that if UK voters vote to stay in the EU, it could send risk assets, including US stocks, higher, while the opposite outcome could put pressure on a wide variety of assets and spark a rally in safe havens, like developed-market sovereign debt.

In addition to watching Brexit headlines, Wall Street will also keep a close eye on comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who was set to appear before US Congress for the second part of her two-day testimony. A report on the housing market is also due out at 10 am ET.

Elsewhere, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell by less than one basis point to 1.702 per cent. US crude oil prices ticked higher by 0.3 per cent to $49.48 a barrel.
