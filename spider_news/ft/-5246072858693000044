Banking stocks plunge in wake of Brexit referendum

2016-06-24

Banking stocks are taking a heavy beating in early trading in Europe, as benchmark equities indices opened sharply lower in the wake of the UK’s decision to vote to leave the European Union.

The sharp fall in financial stocks in early trading in Europe comes after the Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC, StanChart and Prudential took a hammering during the Asian morning. Banking shares have long been seen as among the most vulnerable to a Brexit vote. Deutsche Bank’s chief executive John Cryan did not hold back in comments this morning on the referendum outcome, warning that the consequences will be “negative on all sides”. 

The “leave” camp prevailed in the EU membership referendum despite the final opinion polls pointing towards a victory for “remain”.
