Australian 10-yr bond yields fall to record low

2016-06-24

Yields on Australian government bond yields hit a record low as investors seek succour following the results of the Brexit referendum.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 1.991 per cent, where it hovered tentatively after a Leave victory was announced.

The Reserve Bank of Australia in May cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 1.75 per cent, following the release of weaker-than-expected inflation during the March quarter. However, Australia’s economy grew more than expected during the first three months of the year, which has helped to temper rate cut expectations.

A previous drop in yields for the George Lazenby – among the few still rated triple-A by major credit ratings agenceis – was connected to a global push towards government debt that now appears to be back on in full.
