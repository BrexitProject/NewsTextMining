Sovereign bond yields and stocks recover

2016-06-17

The nervousness that has gripped markets in recent days is abating somewhat, with stocks higher and government bond yields heading away from record-low levels.

The yield on 10-year German Bunds is up two basis points and back at zero, while the yield on 10-year Gilts in the UK is up 4 basis points at 1.15 per cent, writes Michael Hunter. 

Both those yields were among those that touched record lows on Thursday, when the US 10-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest point in nearly four years.

The improvement in sentiment comes after Thursday’s highly cautious trade, which followed polls show growing voter support for Great Britain to leave the EU at next week’s referendum on June 23. Among wider disruptive effects across markets, “Brexit” could also prompt the Bank of England to delay potential interest rate rises.

European equities indices are notably higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.8 per cent in London and the Xetra Dax 30 up 1 per cent in Frankfurt. The region-wide FTSE Euro Stoxx 600 is up 1.2 per cent.

Japanese bourses are leading in Asia, with the Nikkei 225 ahead by 1.1 per cent. The recovery came after a slump of about 3 per cent on Thursday as the Bank of Japan’s decision to refrain from easing monetary policy further spurred the yen to its highest level in 22 months, of ¥103.55 to the dollar. That was unwelcome news for shares of the nation’s exporters.

The yen is now 0.1 per cent weaker at ¥104.41 per dollar but still set for a gain of 2.4 per cent for the week. The Topix and Nikkei 225 were down each down 5.7 per cent so far this week, heading for their largest weekly declines since February 12.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is up 0.5 per cent, while on the mainland China’s Shanghai Composite is up 0.3 per cent.

The dollar is slipping more widely, with the euro up 0.2 per cent at $1.1249, while the pound is 0.4 per cent strongest at $1.4254. The index tracking the world’s reserve currency against six of its peers is down 0.1 per cent overall, eyeing its third straight day of declines, after weak US inflation data, released on Thursday, was no help for the greenback.

Investors continued to process Wednesday’s dovish policy statement from the Fed.
