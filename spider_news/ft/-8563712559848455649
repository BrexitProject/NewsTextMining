‘Remain’ leads in duo of Brexit polls; Pound rises

2016-06-22

The ‘remain’ camp was in the lead in two surveys released late on Wednesday, just hours before a referendum over whether the UK should remain part of the European Union, sending the pound rising.

A poll from ComRes showed 48 per cent of those surveyed would stay in EU, compared with 42 per cent who would vote to leave, while 11 per cent still did not know. Meanwhile, a YouGov survey indicated 51 per cent back ‘remain’, while 49 per cent support ‘leave’.

The figures sent the British pound rallying by 0.4 per cent against the US dollar.
