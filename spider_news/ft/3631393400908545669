US stocks slip ahead of Brexit vote

2016-06-22

US stocks shed their gains after two polls leaned slightly toward ‘leave’ ahead of the UK referendum slated for Thursday, while measures of expected volatility swelled.

The S&P 500 had been up by as much as 0.52 per cent at session highs, but the broad-market barometer fell as jitters about the vote on whether Great Britain should remain in the European Union heated up.

A poll from Opinium showed the leave camp increased its lead over the remain camp to 45 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, 43 per cent of those surveyed by TNS supported leave, a two percentage point lead over stay.

“Our latest poll suggests that leave is in a stronger position than remain but it should be noted that in the Scottish Independence Referendum and the 1995 Quebec Independence Referendum there was a late swing to the status quo and it is possible that the same will happen here,” said Luke Taylor, head of social and political attitudes at TNS.

Meanwhile, the Vix index, a measure of implied S&P 500 volatility over the next month, soared by more than 14 per cent to 21.17, above its long-run average of 20.
