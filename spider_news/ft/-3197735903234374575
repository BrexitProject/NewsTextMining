Sterling knocked further by BoE warning, Survation/IG poll

2016-06-16

The pound has taken a further knock, sinking to a daily low of $1.41, after the Bank of England warned that a Leave vote at next week’s Brexit referendum could cause sterling to fall further – “perhaps sharply” – while the latest opinion poll showed the campaign to quit the EU has increased its lead by seven points.

The pound is now 0.7 per cent down on the day against a weak US dollar as the BoE’s latest statement accompanying its June interest rate decision did little to ease concerns over the potential fall-out from the EU membership referendum.

A telephone poll by research group by Survation, which was published minutes after the Bank’s interest rate decision, showed the “leave” camp has extended its lead to 45 per cent from 38 per cent with just a week to go until Britons go to the polling booths.

The Remain vote has slipped to 42 per cent, according to the Survation poll, which is just the latest to show that Britons are swinging towards an “out” vote.
