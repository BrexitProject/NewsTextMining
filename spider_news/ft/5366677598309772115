US stocks extend rise as energy shares rally

2016-06-21

A late-session rally in energy shares pushed US equities deeper into the black on Tuesday, leaving the S&P 500 poised to notch its second straight day of gains.

The S&P 500 energy sector rallied by 1.2 per cent in afternoon trading, the biggest advance of any of the major groups. The rise came after crude prices pared their losses: US crude was recently down by just 6 cents, having fallen as much as $1.21 at the lows of the day.

The telecommunications sector also rose by more than 1 per cent. Meanwhile, healthcare, consumer discretionary and materials lagged behind.

The subdued activity comes as investors prepare for the vote on Thursday by British citizens over whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. Market strategists and brokers have warned that the referendum could spark a sharp rise in volatility that may interfere with liquidity conditions in certain corners of the market.

In addition to headlines on Brexit, investors also digested comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, who warned that a bout of mixed economic data has clouded the outlook for the US economy.
