Vix logs highest close since Feb as Brexit vote looms

2016-06-22

A closely-watched measure of expected US equity volatility climbed on Wednesday to its highest level in more than four months ahead of Thursdayâ€™s Brexit vote.

The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, soared by 14.6 per cent to 21.2, its highest level since February 18, according to Bloomberg data. The move also knocks the so-called Wall Street fear gauge above its long-run average of 20.

The increase in volatility expectations comes despite a period of relative calm for the S&P 500, which has not closed up or down by more than 1 per cent since May 24.

The sharp rise in implied volatility points to investor angst about the referendum over whether the UK should remain part of the European Union, and expectations of potential tumult on Wall Street this summer, market strategists have noted.
