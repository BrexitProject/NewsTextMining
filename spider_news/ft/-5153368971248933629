Markets: Brexit wounds

2016-06-24

On Thursday, the market got it wrong. Traders dragged themselves out of bed in Friday’s wee hours believing that they were being unnecessarily cautious by going in early. But their phones were already vibrating: Get in here. Now.

Despite being blindsided, the markets did not respond with indiscriminate selling. Yes, a pound buys fewer dollars today than it has in 30 years. On only 10 occasions since 2005 have 10-year US interest rates registered a larger one-day move. But this is not a simple flight from European turmoil to US safety. 

Note that Britain’s FTSE 100 is not Europe’s worst-hit index. Investors are relatively unconcerned about the FTSE 100’s globalised companies. The anxiety was saved for more UK-focused stocks of the FTSE 250, which was hit hard. The Spanish, Italian, French and German indices all sold off as much as the UK mid-caps, or more. The market seems to be pricing in the possibility that European rejectionism will spread to the countries that need unity most. 

The US was not simply a haven, either. While its defensive sectors (telecoms, utilities, and healthcare) all shrugged on Friday, its banks and cyclical stocks were marked down. 

This is, ultimately, the best news yet to come out of Brexit. While the markets got a nasty shock, and the news portends real economic damage, the sell-off was only general for an hour or so. The market responded more or less rationally to reality. Unlike during the last crisis, the sell-off never fed on itself. At least some people are being rational.
