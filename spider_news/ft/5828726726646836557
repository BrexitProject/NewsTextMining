Denmark, Finland face recession risk from Brexit

2016-06-22

Nordic economies could suffer an economic downturn if Britain votes to leave the EU, with Finland and Denmark potentially being tipped back into recession, according to Danske Bank.

Estimating the effect of a “Brexit” on the Nordic nations, Danske said its forecasts for growth in the region could be cut by 0.5-1 percentage points in 2017 if voters opted out of the EU in tomorrow’s referendum.

“Denmark would suffer from its close integration with the European economy, Sweden and Finland from their reliance on exports of investment goods and Norway from a likely drop in the oil price,” said Las Olsen, chief economist at the bank.

Finland – the only Nordic economy in the eurozone – has been the worst performing northern nation in the currency area since the financial crisis and could suffer new downturn after a ‘Leave’ vote.

Mika Kuismanen, head of forecasting at Helsinki’s ministry of finance, said he feared the economy could fall into reverse even if the UK votes to remain.

“The growth is not that strong, other external shocks could have that impact, too,” said Mr Kuismanen on Wednesday.

Danske’s base case forecast is for 1 per cent GDP growth in Finland over 2016-2017, but “Brexit could dent demand for Finnish goods in the EU and lead to a new recession,” said Mr Olsen.

Denmark’s tentative economic recovery could also be derailed, wiping out hopes of a more than 1 per cent growth in output next year, said Danske.

Should Britain exit the EU, “it would probably trigger a temporary decline in business investment and also dampen private consumption both in the UK and across Europe,” said the bank.

Denmark is also likely to see haven currency inflows, pushing down interest rates and forcing the central bank into easing measures, noted Mr Olsen.
