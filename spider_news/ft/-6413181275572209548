Lagarde welcomes central bank cooperation after Brexit

2016-06-24

The International Monetary Fund’s managing director has put out the following statement after the UK’s historic EU vote, noting the fund is “monitoring developments:

We take note of the decision by the people of the United Kingdom. We urge the authorities in the UK and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the UK and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process.

We strongly support commitments of the Bank of England and the ECB to supply liquidity to the banking system and curtail excess financial volatility.

We will continue to monitor developments closely and stand ready to support our members as needed.

Ms Lagarde’s statement comes as finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 nations expressed concerns on the volatile market moves following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, saying they are “ready to use the established liquidity instruments” to support the market functioning.

“We recognize excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability,” the ministers said in a statement issued shortly after a teleconference Friday.

They continued:

G7 central banks have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets. We stand ready to use the established liquidity instruments to that end.

We will continue to consult closely on market movements and financial stability, and cooperate as appropriate.

We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7.
