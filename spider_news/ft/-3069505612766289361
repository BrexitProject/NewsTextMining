Fast Asia Open: Brexit vs Yellen

2016-06-21

It was a calmer session for investors overnight, with equities continuing their march higher, government bonds mostly retreating and the British pound ending lower.

The UK’s referendum on Thursday about whether to leave the European Union continues to drive sentiment in global markets, overshadowing Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s semi-annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday.

Ms Yellen reiterated her cautious stance on the outlook for US monetary policy, saying she saw “considerable uncertainty” about the nation’s economic outlook. That follows May’s weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls number, as well as some international hazards such as a potentially adverse outcome from this week’s Brexit vote.

Overnight, the S&P 500 ended 0.3 per cent higher, the FTSE 100 gained 0.4 per cent and European stocks were up about 0.8 per cent.

The pound was up 0.1 per cent at $1.4664 in Asia this morning, having shed 0.3 per cent yesterday, while the yen was flat today at ¥‎104.79 per dollar after a 0.8 per cent depreciation on Tuesday. The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of global peers, rose 0.4 per cent yesterday.

Futures tip Japan’s Nikkei 225 to open unchanged this morning, for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 to rise 0.3 per cent and for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng to open flat.

Here are the highlights of today’s economic calendar, which is otherwise light save for the Bank of Thailand’s interest rate decision later in the afternoon (Hong Kong times):
