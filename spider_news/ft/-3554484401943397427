Pound rallies to ’16 high as Brexit anxiety cools

2016-06-22

The pound zipped sharply higher late on Wednesday after two polls tilted toward the ‘remain’ side before the referendum on whether the UK should part ways with the European Union.

Sterling rallied by 0.8 per cent against the dollar to $1.482 at the start of Thursday’s trading session, which would mark the highest level on a closing basis since December 28, according to Bloomberg data. It had advanced by 0.4 per cent in the Wednesday session that ended at 5pm ET.

Two polls released late in the day suggested voters were leaning toward a ‘stay’ vote in the referendum that is scheduled for Thursday.
