Brexit vote fuels wave of risk aversion

2016-06-24

Friday 21:00 BST. Equities, commodities and emerging market assets came under intense selling pressure as a wave of risk aversion swept through global markets in the wake of the Leave campaign’s victory in the UK’s referendum on EU membership.

The result came as a major shock to many market participants, who had spent much of the previous week positioning themselves for a Remain win.

Sterling plunged to its lowest level against the dollar in three decades and the 10-year UK gilt yield tumbled to a record low, while the FTSE 100 share index was down as much as 8.7 per cent at one stage as banking stocks sank.

Gold, the Japanese yen and “core” government bonds were the chief beneficiaries in the ensuing “flight to safety”.

“Markets are struggling with the incalculable and far-reaching implications of ‘Brexit’ for European capital flows, echoing the similar uncertainty that led to broad asset dislocation seen during the Lehman and Greece crises,” said Lena Komileva at G+ Economics.

“The Brexit vote will have deep structural and financial implications for the UK and European economies, with global spillover effects.”

Yet by the end of the European trading day, a fair portion of the early UK market moves had been unwound. The pound — which hit a six-month high of $1.50 against the dollar late on Thursday — was trading at $1.3673, down 8.1 per cent on the day but well off the day’s low of $1.3232.

The 10-year gilt yield finished at 1.09 per cent, down 29bp, having hit 1.02 per cent early in the session while the FTSE 100 pared its decline to finish 3.2 per cent lower on the day, and was actually up 2 per cent from a week earlier.

The more-domestically focused FTSE 250 index settled 7.2 per cent lower on Friday, having been down more than 12 per cent at one point.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said it would “not hesitate to take additional measures as required as markets adjust”, insisting that the BoE was “well prepared” for volatility and that the financial system was more resilient than at the time of the financial crisis.

The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank said they were standing by to inject extra liquidity.

Continental European equities had a worse time of it than their UK counterparts. The Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell 6.8 per cent — led by double-digit falls for Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank — while the Italian and Spanish markets both ended more than 12 per cent lower.

The pan-regional Stoxx 600 index fell 7 per cent.

“The markets seem in little doubt that the UK vote bodes ill for the eurozone,” said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight.

“Indeed, there is the very real risk that still significant banking sector problems in some eurozone countries will be aggravated by weakened eurozone growth and more difficult funding conditions.”

Central banks cannot take market moves like this lying down

The euro was down 2.2 per cent against the dollar at $1.1125.

The losses for European bank stocks came as so-called “peripheral” eurozone government bond prices sank. In Spain — which holds a general election on Sunday — the 10-year yield hit a four-month high of 1.74 per cent before edging back to 1.64 per cent, still up 17 basis points on the day.

“With social unrest and political fragmentation increasing elsewhere in Europe in recent years, there is a risk that the outcome of the UK referendum will amplify pressures on other member states,” said Alain Bokobza, global strategist at Société Générale.

“Indeed, the UK ‘Out’ campaign has some similarities with anti-elite and anti-EU movements active across continental Europe.”

On Wall Street, meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent to a three-month low of 2,037 — its biggest one-day decline since August last year — taking it below where it ended 2015. The benchmark index ended 1.6 per cent lower on the week.

The broad sense of unease was illustrated well by a hefty 43 per cent jump for the CBOE Vix volatility index to 24.75 in late trade, the highest since February and well above its long-term average of 20.

The MSCI emerging markets equity index was down 3.6 per cent, its worst performance since August. EM currencies also fell sharply with the dollar up 3.9 per cent against the Mexican peso and 4.5 per cent versus the South African rand.

But the dominant force on the currency markets was the yen, as its traditional “haven” status came to the fore. The dollar was down 3.6 per cent at ¥102.32 — after earlier hitting ¥99.11, the lowest since November 2013. 

The euro was off 5.8 per cent at ¥113.77 while sterling was down 11.2 per cent at ¥139.95.

Gold also gained significantly amid the heightened caution in the markets. The metal was up $63, or 5.1 per cent, at $1,318 an ounce — after earlier hitting $1,358, its highest since March 2014.

German and US government bonds were also in demand from nervous participants. With many arguing that Brexit would further delay any rise in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve, two-year and 10-year Treasury yields were down 13bp and 17bp at 0.65 per cent and 1.57 per cent, respectively. 

The 10-year German Bund yield touched a record minus 0.17 per cent before closing at minus 0.05 per cent, down 15bp.

Worries about the outlook for energy demand helped push Brent oil down 4.9 per cent to settle at $48.41 a barrel. But copper trimmed an early fall to end 1.7 per cent lower in London at $4,698 a tonne.
