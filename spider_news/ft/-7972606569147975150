Subject to laws we have no influence in shaping

2016-06-16

Sir, Henry Mance is wrong (“ Out executives open to self-interest claims”, June 15). It is a risk for any business leader to back Brexit. Most big companies, Dyson included, depend in some way on government — so it is no surprise that some leaders of big business are pinning their colours to the government mast. However, I cannot remain silent when I see Britain ceding control of its destiny to an institution, the EU, that has so little regard for Britain’s interests. We should not be ceding any control — the US, Japan or Australia would never do so.

As someone who has had to deal with European bodies, and the impact of their protectionist laws and regulations, over the past 25 years, I can confirm that we have no influence whatsoever in their shaping. Worse, Britain is subject to those laws yet has no influence over them. One thing is certain, the status quo is not an option; we either go deeper in, losing more control, or leave and take control of our own future. Who would not want to shape their own future?
