Transferwise to limit GBP transfers ahead of Brexit vote

2016-06-21

Companies are bracing themselves for a week of extreme volatility as the UK votes on Thursday over whether to leave or remain in the European Union.

Transferwise, the UK-based money-transfer operator, has become the latest company to caution on the expected market swings. In an email to customers on Tuesday, it said it will be imposing restrictions on transfers involving pounds beginning at 7am Thursday UK time until Friday when the referendum results are revealed.

It added:

Because the exchange rate is likely to be volatile, some transfers may take longer due to additional trading limits or possible delays in the UK banking system on Thursday or Friday.

The move comes as UBS also warned that it may struggle to accommodate trading in the run up to and following the vote. The Swiss bank said in an email message:

Regardless of the outcome, we may see an increase in volatility and an impact on trading volumes. In the event that extreme market moves occur in an environment of limited liquidity, our principal spreads may widen for both electronic and voice trading, liquidity may reduce and prices may turn indicative (i.e., non-tradable) for periods of time.

Nervousness over the potential fallout from a Brexit vote has roiled markets in recent weeks. The market is bracing for sharp moves – particularly in the currency market – late Thursday night when results from the vote start coming in.
