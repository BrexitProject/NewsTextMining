Economists have a record of getting it wrong

2016-06-16

Sir, Chris Giles, in “ Economists’ rare unity highlights the perils of Brexit” (June 16), suggests that when economists reach a strong consensus, it is more likely to be right. History suggests otherwise. The 364 economists who wrote a letter to The Times protesting against the 1981 Budget said there was “no basis in economic theory or supporting evidence for the government’s belief that by deflating demand . . . [it would] induce an automatic recovery in output”. Only a handful of economists stood against this consensus. Yet publication of this letter coincided with an economic recovery which saw domestic demand grow at an annualised rate of 3.3 per cent over the next five years.

Then in 1999 The Economist conducted a survey of 164 economists which found that two-thirds were in favour of giving up the pound and joining the euro. Yet we now know this would have been a massive policy blunder for the UK. Indeed the bias in favour of joining the single currency, at that time, was all the more remarkable given that, earlier that decade, Britain endured a disastrous dress rehearsal with its unhappy participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.

With this shocking record, it is entirely possible that the perils of Brexit are being overstated by majority of economists.
