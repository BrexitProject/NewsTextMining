US stocks soar as Brexit anxiety cools

2016-06-20

The S&P 500 kicked off the week in rally mode on Monday, jumping 1.3 per cent, as concerns over this week’s Brexit vote waned.

Wall Street’s other major gauges also climbed on the day: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite both advanced by 1.4 per cent.

The gains on Monday were led by economically-sensitive sectors, including financials and and industrials, that have been beaten down recently. Defensive shares, which are favoured for their dividends, lagged behind, with the utilities sector logging a slight decline.

Meanwhile, the Vix index, a measure of implied S&P 500 volatility, plunged by 12.8 per cent after rising sharply over the past three weeks.
