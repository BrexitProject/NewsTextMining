Steinhoff reconsiders Poundland bid after Brexit vote

2016-06-24

South African conglomerate Steinhoff has said it is reviewing its proposed takeover of Poundland, following resistance from Poundland’s board and the UK’s shock decision to leave the EU.

Steinhoff has amassed a 23 per cent stake in the discount retailer, and last week said it was considering a full takeover after speculation had fuelled a sharp jump in the UK retailer’s share price.

But in a statement on Friday, Steinhoff said “the Board of Poundland has not accepted our proposal regarding a possible cash offer.” Steinhoff added that it was “considering its position” on the deal.

It cited Poundland’s weak full year results released last week – pre-tax profits fell 84 per cent – as well as the “recent movement in the share price” and “the impact of the EU Referendum on global markets.”

A deal for Poundland would mark Steinhoff’s first success in European dealmaking this year, after failing to acquire French retailer Darty and Argos owner Home Retail Group.
