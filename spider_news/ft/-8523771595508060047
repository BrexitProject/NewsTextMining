Our openness has allowed us to cherry pick the best

2016-06-16

Sir, James Blitz is surely right to highlight the centrality of free movement to the Brexit cause (“ The Remain camp seeks an answer to the free movement question”, Instant Insight, FT.com, June 14). But it is sad how little consideration is given to the enormous skill and productivity benefits we have gained, courtesy of flexible labour movement.

Some 26 years ago I was a graduate trainee at a prominent UK merchant bank. The 20 of us trainees were, as far as I recall, all white British, with only four women. Most of us achieved rather little of any value in our first two or three years and spent a considerable time moaning about how little we felt we were paid.

Twenty-six years later I am still in the same industry but my team couldn’t be more different, especially the younger cohort in their twenties. As well as Brits we have young people from Italy, France, Germany, Serbia, India and the US, among others. Half are women. More to the point, what they achieve, the intensity and diligence with which they work, how they care about our clients — it takes my breath away sometimes. I am so proud of them, and here is the terrible thing: talented, energetic young people are coming to me to say they are not sure whether they are really welcome in this country any more. Brexit doesn’t send a message just to Europe. The openness and relative meritocracy of the UK has enabled us to cherry pick some of the best young people from all over Europe and beyond and what economic success we have achieved owes a huge debt to them.

Britain will be so much the poorer if we turn our collective back on our closest friends in the world. Please tell me the spirit of openness, co-operation and tolerance — which I had thought a very British trait — is not a dying light in our country today.
