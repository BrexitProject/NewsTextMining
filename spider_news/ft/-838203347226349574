European stocks rise ahead of UK vote

2016-06-22

Wednesday 21:00 BST. European stocks enjoyed another day of gains and sterling held close to its 2016 high against the dollar as the countdown to the UK referendum on EU membership entered the home straight. 

UK government bond yields continued to pull away from the historic lows touched at the height of a recent bout of nerves over the possibility of “Brexit”, while the yen spent much of the day trading with a broadly softer bias and gold maintained its retreat from last week’s two-year high above $1,300 an ounce. 

“Ahead of what many people expect to be a potentially monumental couple of days for the markets, investors seem to be taking the approach of the UK referendum very much in their stride and adopting a ‘pro-risk’ bias in positioning,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank.

“Sterling/dollar’s 5 per cent-plus rally from last week’s low reflects the market’s more certain view of the likely outcome of the referendum. Bookmaker odds reflect the view that Remain will probably prevail.

“With the last-minute polling still reflecting a tight race, however, markets are likely to remain somewhat guarded.”

The pound rose as high as $1.4773 on Wednesday, just a whisker shy of the previous day’s near six-month peak. Sterling/dollar has not traded above $1.48 since January 4.

The UK currency subsequently eased back to stand at $1.4696, still up 0.4 per cent on the day.

Sterling was also up 0.1 per cent versus the yen at ¥153.57.

How growth, trade, migration and more would be affected by a split with the EU

Equity markets appeared relatively relaxed, although Wall Street suffered a late bout of selling following two days of gains.

The FTSE 100 index in London climbed 0.6 per cent to a two-week high and the pan-European Stoxx 600 rose 0.4 per cent.

But the S&P 500 ended 0.2 per cent lower at 2,085, having earlier reached 2,099.71. That still left the benchmark index up 1.7 per cent from a low hit less than a week ago, but about 1.8 per cent shy of the 2016 intraday high it reached on June 8.

Reflecting the lingering uncertainty over the referendum outcome, the CBOE Vix volatility index was up nearly 15 per cent in late trade and above the 21 level. 

Energy stocks underperformed on both sides of the Atlantic as oil prices retreated — even after data showed US crude stocks declining for a fifth successive week.

Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell 1.5 per cent to settle at $49.88 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate was 1.5 per cent lower at $49.10.

By contrast, copper reached a two-week high in London — rising 0.6 per cent to $4,700 a tonne — as the industrial metals markets took heart from the more confident mood seen elsewhere.

The broadly weaker tone of the dollar lent further support to the copper price. The dollar index, a measure of the currency against a weighted basket of peers, was down 0.3 per cent, largely reflecting a 0.5 per cent rise for the euro to $1.1297. 

Gold was down $3 at $1,265 an ounce after earlier hitting $1,261.

The single currency was also up 0.2 per cent against the yen at ¥117.94.

Dollar/yen, however, was down 0.3 per cent at ¥104.41 — and still in sight of Tuesday’s two-year low of ¥103.57.

“Only part of the current strength of the yen is due to safe-haven demand linked to the uncertainty over the UK’s membership of the EU,” said Julian Jessop at Capital Economics.

“Instead, the more important driver of the yen still seems to be expectations for US interest rates. Of course, these in turn are influenced by the impact that the UK vote might have on Federal Reserve policy. However, the yen has also been supported by the perception that US interest rates will remain lower for longer regardless of the results of the referendum.”

On Tuesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen delivered a cautious assessment of the US economy in her semi-annual testimony to Congress, reinforcing the view a rise in interest rates next month was unlikely.

Her testimony “gave the impression the Fed is in no hurry to tighten, mirroring the message from June’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting”, said Nick Stamenkovic, macro strategist at RIA Capital Markets.

“Ms Yellen reiterated her concern about the labour market and highlighted ‘considerable’ uncertainty abut the US economy. Still, a gradual upturn is the main scenario for the Fed.”

US Treasury prices inched higher on Wednesday with the 10-year yield down 1 basis point at 1.69 per cent and the two-year down 2bp at 0.75 per cent.

The 10-year German Bund yield edged up 1bp to 0.06 per cent while that on the 10-year gilt rose 2bp to 1.31 per cent.
