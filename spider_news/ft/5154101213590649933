ZEW: Brexit a worry, but cheerful tone from German economists

2016-06-21

German economists are feeling surprisingly upbeat, according to the latest survey from the ZEW think-tank.

After a dip last month, blamed in part on the UK’s EU vote, the latest survey covering sentiment on current conditions has produced a reading of 54.5, up from 53.1 in May and also above an expected reading of 53. The expectations survey result stands at 19.2, up from 6.4 and well above the forecast of 4.8.

The think tank’s president Achim Wambach said in a statement:

The improvement of economic sentiment indicates that the financial market experts have confidence in the resilience of the German economy. However, general economic conditions remain challenging. Apart from the weak global economic dynamics, it is mainly the EU referendum in Great Britain which causes uncertainty.
