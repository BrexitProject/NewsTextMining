Variation may be elegant, but it confuses

2016-06-21

Sir, Gillian Tett should review the principle of elegant variation, usually judged to be a fault by good writers. If she writes “financial geeks” in one paragraph, she should not write “those financial nerds” in the next when she is clearly referring to the same group of people (“ Give geeks their say on Brexit”, June 17). If one means the same thing, one should use the same word.
