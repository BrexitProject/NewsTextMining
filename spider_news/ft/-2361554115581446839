Late pick-up for sterling near $1.40

2016-06-16

A poor day for the Queen’s pound, albeit with some support kicking in now.

The UK currency is now within striking distance of falling through the $1.40 mark after dropping by as much as 1.2 per cent this morning in New York to $1.4013. At pixel time, it has picked up slightly to $1.4060.

Bets against sterling have been piling up hard and fast in recent days as the latest opinion polls showed that the Leave camp – which is pushing for the UK to leave the European Union at the referendum next week – has strengthened its lead over the Remain campaign.

The Bank of England did little to assuage concerns over the potential financial fallout from a so-called Brexit, saying the sterling could fall further – “perhaps sharply” as a result.

Thursday’s drop has pretty much helped erase the gains made by the currency in April and May. It is now back on track towards the seven-year low of $1.3836 reached in February.
