A small minority may decide the fate of us all

2016-06-20

Sir, Assuming a 75 per cent turnout for the EU referendum and a close vote for Brexit (say 52 per cent), this would mean that under 40 per cent of the electorate supported Brexit.

Last year the government proposed that for workers in essential services to go on strike at least 40 per cent of those qualified to vote had to approve the action. So leaving the EU referendum — potentially a major constitutional change — has a lower threshold than that proposed for industrial action.

If you count the whole population, including those under 18 denied a vote (most of whom probably support remaining in the EU), a 52 per cent vote in favour of Brexit represents about 25 per cent of UK residents. So a small minority — just one quarter of the UK population — could determine the future of the majority.
