Euro banking index hits lowest level since 2012

2016-06-16

An index tracking European banks has hit its lowest level since August 2012 as nervousness has once again taken hold of markets today, pushing yields on government bonds viewed as “safer” investments down to yet new fresh lows.

The Euro Stoxx banks index has dropped a further 2 per cent today to 88.7, the weakest level for nearly four years (see chart below from Bloomberg).

Financial stocks are bearing the brunt of falls in European equities markets this morning, as investors react to the latest policy statement from the US Federal Reserve, inaction from the Bank of Japan and continued fears over the outcome of the UK’s EU membership referendum.

At its June meeting, the Fed acknowledged slower than expected growth in the US jobs market in May and joined a number of central banks around the world in highlighting the UK’s Brexit referendum as a possible risk to growth.

Deutsche Bank‘s shares have dropped to an all-time low of €12.83 earlier and has been joined by its German rival Commerzbank at the bottom of the Dax.

The chart above highlights the biggest fallers at publication time on the Euro Stoxx banks index.
