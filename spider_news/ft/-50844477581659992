Draghi: ECB made all preparations for Brexit

2016-06-21

Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has said the ECB has done “all the preparation” necessary to cope with the fall-out from the UK’s looming EU referendum.

Two days ahead of the vote, Mr Draghi reassured a parliamentary committee in Brussels that policymakers were “prepared for all contingencies following the UK’s EU referendum”.

“We’ve done all the preparation that is necessary now”, said the Italian, speaking after the ECB’s executive board met on Tuesday discuss their Brexit contingency measures.

He added that it was “very difficult to foresee the impact and various dimensions of how the vote in the UK will impact markets and the economies of the eurozone”.

A host of central bankers from Japan to Switzerland have said they stand ready to provide additional liquidity to financial markets should the UK vote to leave the EU on Thursday.

The ECB and Bank of England last cooperated to offer foreign currency “swap” lines to banks across borders and time zones at the height of the financial crisis.

Mr Draghi said the ECB had ensured existing swap lines would be sufficient to cope with a post-Brexit scenario.

“We have existing swap lines with other central banks and have existing liability arrangements. We’ve been there before and make sure they are usable, active and adequate.”
