Eurozone activity falls to lowest since Dec ’14

2016-06-23

Private sector output in the eurozone slowed to its weakest pace in 17 months in June, in another sign economic momentum is receding in the currency bloc.

Output in the services and manufacturing sectors, as measured by Markit’s composite purchasing manager’s index, reached 52.8 this month, below economist expectations of a reading of 53, and lower than the 53.1 hit in May.

Business activity slowed on the back of a weak month for the services sector, where output slipped to an 18-month low but still expanded at 52.4. Any number above 50 indicates expansion.

Firms’ future business outlook also declined to its worst level since July 2015, “with companies often citing worries about political change and rising economic uncertainty, albeit with few explicit references to a potential ‘Brexit’”, said Markit.

There was positive news from the manufacturing sector, which despite falling in the doldrums in France, hit a six-month high, rising to 52.6 from 51.5 in May.

Overall, the June figures point to “disappointingly lacklustre economic growth” in the second quarter of the year, after the currency area recorded better than expected GDP growth of 0.6 per cent at the start of the year, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

Growth is set to slip to just 0.3 per cent in the middle of the year, said Mr Williamson, adding:

The good news is that demand is growing at a sufficiently strong pace to sustain reasonably robust hiring, but it’s not strong enough to generate inflationary pressures. Firms are having to soak up higher costs, notably for fuel and labour, but cut their own selling prices amid intense competition
