Gold miners shining while other sectors dive

The only sparkle in a tumbling market.

Shares of gold miners are soaring on Friday following the surge in gold prices overnight as UK’s decision to exit the European Union unfolded.

Seven of the top 10 risers in today’s FTSE all-share index are producers of the yellow metal.

Acacia Mining tops the list, up 15 per cent on yesterday’s close, followed by Randgold Resources, Fresnillo and Centamin which have all jumped double digits.

Seen as a haven, gold prices hit a two-year high of $1,358 a troy ounce early this morning as the Brexit results came out and pointed to an unexpectedly decisive victory for the Leave campaign. It is now at around $1,312 an ounce, still a level not seen since July 2014.
