2016-06-17

Here’s a taste of today’s UK politics email. You can sign up for the full briefing here. 

British politics was united in grief following the murder of Jo Cox, a 41-year old Labour MP. Campaigning in the EU referendum has been suspended until Saturday at least.

Ms Cox was known for her work on Syria, and regarded as a rising star in parliament. Her death raises fresh questions about politicians’ security arrangements. The murder suspect was described as “friendly but a loner”.
