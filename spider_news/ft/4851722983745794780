Yen gains ground in volatile session

2016-06-16

Thursday 21:00 BST. An exceptionally volatile session saw a resumption of Brexit-fuelled risk aversion drive the yen sharply higher, while gold and sterling swung wildly and US stocks inched ahead for the first time in six days.

So-called “peripheral” eurozone government bond yields hit their highest in a month as “core” sovereign yields in Europe and Japan stayed at record lows. The Federal Reserve’s cautious tone after its latest open market committee meeting helped push the 10-year US Treasury yield to its lowest for nearly four years.

But it was the currency markets that really caught the eye as the dollar tumbled by as much as 2.3 per cent against the yen to touch ¥103.61, its lowest since September 2014, after the Bank of Japan refrained from easing monetary policy further.

The dollar later pulled back to ¥104.32, still down 1.6 per cent on the day. The euro was down 1.8 per cent versus the yen at ¥117.21 while sterling was 1.5 per cent weaker at ¥148.30. 

Antje Praefcke, senior FX strategist at Commerzbank, noted that the only change from the BoJ was that it now expects inflation to be “slightly lower”.

“That points towards a downward revision of its inflation outlook in July and, in addition to the strong yen, provides further fuel for the expectation of further expansionary measures during the course of the year,” she said.

Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “The latest rally of the yen, a continuation of an uptrend since late January, is a strong demonstration of its ascendant position as the ultimate ‘safe haven’ in global financial markets.

“Its appreciation against the dollar is especially impressive in light of the latter’s own rise against other currencies and prospects for more [policy] accommodation by the BoJ in the near future.”

Indeed, the dollar briefly regained its poise after weakening markedly in the immediate aftermath of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement, although the rally proved tentative.

By late afternoon in New York, the dollar index was flat at 94.58, after earlier reaching 95.32, as the euro pared an earlier fall to trade just 0.2 per cent softer at $1.1236.

Sterling bounced off a two-month low of $1.4010 to stand a shade higher at $1.4210.

“As anticipated, the Fed did not only leave its policy stance unchanged but also refrained from making any policy-relevant adjustments to its post-meeting statement,” said analysts at UniCredit.

“The FOMC members’ interest projections still indicate two rate hikes for 2016, but there are now six out of 17 members who only see one hike for this year. The announcements by the Fed and the BoJ lent further support to the fixed income universe.”

For UK and German government bonds, it was a case of “another day, another record low” as the 10-year gilt yield touched 1.072 per cent, before ending 1 basis point lower at 1.11 per cent, and the 10-year Bund yield shed 1bp to minus 0.02 per cent. Japan’s 10-year JGB yield ended flat at minus 0.20 per cent.

But the Spanish and Italian 10-year yields each rose 5bp to 1.61 and 1.48 per cent, respectively. 

Across the Atlantic, the 10-year US Treasury yield touched 1.518 per cent, its lowest since August 2012, before climbing back to 1.57 per cent, down 2bp on the day. The yield hit a record low of 1.38 per cent in July 2012. 

The more policy-sensitive two-year yield reversed an earlier dip to trade 1bp higher at 0.69 per cent.

“The Fed statement and [chair Janet] Yellen’s press conference has provided the green light for markets to price out the probability of a July rate hike,” noted analysts at Morgan Stanley.

Indeed, fed fund futures moved to price in just a 2 per cent probability of a Fed move next month, and gave odds of less than 40 per cent on a rate rise occurring by February 2017, according to Bloomberg calculations.

The pushing back of Fed expectations and the relentless retreat for “core” bond yields helped gold rise as high as $1.315 an ounce, its most expensive since August 2014, although the metal could not sustain its momentum and last traded at $1,280, down $10 on the day.

There was some respite for recently battered US equities as the S&P 500 recouped an early 1 per cent fall to end 0.3 per cent higher at 2,078. The index had fallen on each of the past five sessions after reaching a 2016 intraday high last week.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.7 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo tumbled 3.1 per cent to its lowest since mid-April, reflecting the early surge in the yen.

The renewed weakness for global stocks came as oil prices fell sharply, with Brent crude settling at $47.19 a barrel, down 3.6 per cent. 

The international energy benchmark has now fallen for six days in a row, shedding more than 10 per cent in the process.
