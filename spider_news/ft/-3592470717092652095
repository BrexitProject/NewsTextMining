Brexit vote confirms that this is not the time for airy cosmopolitanism

2016-06-24

Sir, Sir Martin Sorrell, who called for Britons to remain in the EU because “borders of all kinds are increasingly notional” for young people, made the right argument for the wrong reasons ( Comment, June 22).

Today’s backlash against globalisation – of which Brexiters are but one manifestation – springs from the fact that substantial minorities in many rich countries feel so excluded from its benefits that they are willing to risk dramatic economic self-harm.

Several policies needed to give all citizens a stake in the open global economy – education, social protection, a fair chance at a decent job – currently can only be implemented by national governments. (Though international co-operation on tax could help them raise more revenue.)

Thursday’s decision confirms that this is no time for airy cosmopolitanism. Deluding ourselves that borders are irrelevant opens the door for nationalism to return with a vengeance.
