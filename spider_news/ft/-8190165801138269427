Negativity over Turkey’s accession is deplorable

2016-06-19

Sir, As a Turkish citizen with high regard for European values and ideals, I find it deplorable that Turkey’s EU accession process has been treated in such a negative manner during Brexit debates, and most recently in your editorial “ Britain should vote to stay in the EU” (June 16).

It is worrisome that the Financial Times has also joined the train in this respect, with its negative predictions on Turkey’s accession process together with a cynical quote on the name of its largest city, which are completely out of context. Such discourse shows that we have indeed come a long way from postwar European idealism.

It seems that the spirit of European integration, particularly following the end of communism, has been replaced by cynical scaremongering. I would not have expected a serious newspaper such as the FT to base one of its Remain arguments on keeping Turkey out of the EU.
