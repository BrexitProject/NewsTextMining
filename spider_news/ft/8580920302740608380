BoE’s Carney blasts efforts at Brexit muzzling

2016-06-16

Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has responded forcefully to behind-the-scenes attempts to muzzle the central bank, saying that a leading Leave campaigner’s threats contained “numerous and substantial” misconceptions.

The bank has infuriated the Leave campaign by highlighting that Brexit is the greatest domestic threat to financial stability and could lead to a recession. It confirmed it received a threatening letter on Monday ahead of Thursday’s minutes of the monetary policy committee and Mr Carney’s Mansion House speech, writes Chris Giles.

The letter from Bernard Jenkin MP, chairman of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, warned the governor not to break “purdah” rules and received an angry response from the governor.

“All of the public comments that I, or other Bank officials, have made regarding issues related to the referendum have been limited to factors that affect the Bank’s statutory responsibilities and have been entirely consistent with our remits”, Mr Carney wrote.

He also confirmed that the BoE was not bound by purdah rules, but had agreed voluntarily to abide by them, including the governor’s long-standing plan to talk about subjects other than the EU in Thurday evenening’s Mansion House speech.

The BoE said, however, that the MPC minutes would be published “as normal” and the committee would comment on the risks to the economy in line with its remit.

Hitting back at Mr Jenkin’s warning that the BoE was “prohibited from making any public comment” Mr Carney said:

In the future I would be grateful if you would do me and my fellow independent committee members the courtesy of consulting the public record before writing letters such as that which I received on Monday.
