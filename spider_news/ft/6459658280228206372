Sterling pops to year’s high as poll puts ‘Remain’ ahead

2016-06-23

OK. Here we go.

It took a few minutes to sink in, but the latest indication that the result of the referendum will be to Remain in the EU has given sterling a kick higher. It’s now at its highest point of the year at $1.4988, up by 0.7 per cent on the day so far (which has only been running for 12 minutes).

Says James Knightley at ING:

Making a big leap to assume these sample polls are correct, it should provide a near-term boost to the economy. if it is true, the slowdown in investment and hiring caused by the uncertainty that the vote has generated should reverse and the UK economy should revert back towards trend growth. We also think that inflation pressures will pick up due to labour market tightness and there will be a growing sense that a Bank of England rate hike won’t be too far away. We still think February 2017 with a second rate hike in the second half of 2017.

And BNP Paribas writes:

An update of our positioning analysis suggests that some market participants had reduced sterling shorts heading into the voting but overall positioning remained substantially short, suggesting scope for a further relief rally in the pound in the event a “remain” vote is confirmed.
