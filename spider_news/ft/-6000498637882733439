Japan braces for Brexit fallout

2016-06-24

Japanese authorities were locked in crisis meetings as the vote for Brexit sent the yen crashing through Y100 to the dollar.

Taro Aso, the finance minister, said he stood ready to take “firm action on the yen if needed” as he warned of “extremely nervous movements” in financial markets. On currency intervention, Mr Aso said he “had nothing to say at this time”, writes Robin Harding in Tokyo.

Policymakers in Tokyo were already alarmed by the strength of the yen so far this year because it hurts Japanese exports and weighs on inflation. However, they would rather any intervention was coordinated by the Group of Seven – increasing the chances of success, and avoiding accusations of starting a currency war.

Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he stood ready to provide liquidity to the banking system, including foreign currency loans if necessary.

“In close collaboration with domestic and international authorities, we are watching the effects of the British referendum result on international markets,” Mr Kuroda said.

“The BOJ stands ready to supply liquidity including utilisation of agreed swap lines with six central banks.”
