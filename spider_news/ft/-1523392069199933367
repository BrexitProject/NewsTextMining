Indian central bank conducting Brexit ‘vigil’

2016-06-22

The Reserve Bank of India is keeping a close eye on tomorrow’s EU referendum in the UK, noting that what it calls “The Brexit” has been causing turbulence in financial markets even on its shores.

In a short statement, the RBI says:

Uncertainty about the poll outcome has resulted in some amount of turbulence in global financial markets, including in India. The RBI is maintaining a close vigil on developments, and will take all necessary steps, including liquidity support, to ensure orderly conditions in financial markets.
