Central banks in ‘close communication’ over Brexit vote – Kuroda

2016-06-16

The Bank of Japan is in “close communication” with the Bank of England and other global central banks ahead of the UK’s EU referendum, according to its governor Haruhiko Kuroda.

In the latest sign that the world’s policymakers are preparing measures to potentially backstop financial markets in the event of a ‘leave’ vote, Mr Kuroda said the BoJ was closely monitoring the British referendum and said fears over an exit have led to Japanese government bond yields falling to record lows.

His comments come a day after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said US policymakers had taken consideration of the June 23 referendum when it decided to stay pat on another interest rate rise in June.

The European Central Bank has also said it stands ready to stabilise financial markets through additional liquidity provisions “if necessary”.

In an attempt to soothe market fears ahead of the vote, the Bank of England provided its first special liquidity operation window to commercial banks on Tuesday – a measure which sees it flood lenders with a wall of money to prevent scares over a bank run. It will do so again on June 21.

Mr Kuroda’s comments, which were reported by Reuters, were made as the BoJ decided to stay steady on another interest rate cut on Thursday.

With just a week before the vote, sterling has fallen to $1.4140 against the dollar, nearing a two-month low. The pound is also weaker against the euro, which has climbed to £0.80, sterling’s weakest level since the end of April.

Global central banks such as the BoE, Fed and ECB last cooperated to stabilise market conditions and provide currency swap lines in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008.
