German factories enjoy best month since early 2014

What Brexit woes?

Germany’s dominant manufacturing sector outstripped economist expectations in June, powering to record its best monthly performance since the start of 2014.

Output in the sector, as measured by Markit’s purchasing manager’s index, rose to 54.4 this month, as international demand for German exports from the US and China recorded its best level in 24 months.

The expansion was also better than the 52 expected by analysts (any marker above 50 indicates growth). Private sector companies surveyed by Markit reported a better international economic environment which lead to strong demand for German goods. New export orders rose at their best level in 2.5 years.

But robust factory performance was not matched by a subdued month for services, where output fell to a 13-month low but still expanded with a reading of 53.2.

Germany’s overall composite PMI hit 54.1, moderating from the 54.5 registered in May but enough to suggest Europe’s largest economy is “continuing its uninterrupted expansionary trend that started over three years ago”, said Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit.

Having expanded by a bumper 0.7 per cent at the start of the year, June’s PMI figures suggests GDP will grow steadily again in the second quarter.

“Today’s PMIs indicate that the cyclical momentum in the eurozone’s core economy remains strong, and that it is increasingly balanced between manufacturing/exports and domestic demand”, said Claus Vistesen at Pantheon.

“The only dark spot for the private sector as a whole was that margins contracted as firms maintained selling prices, despite rising input costs due to higher commodity prices and higher wages”, he said.
