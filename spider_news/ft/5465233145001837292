Peripheral bonds bounce; Gilts and Bunds sell-off

2016-06-23

Rising confidence that the UK will vote to remain in EU is giving riskier sovereign bonds a lift. Peripheral eurozone government debt is rallying, while haven Gilts and Bunds are selling-off.

Portuguese 10-year yields have dropped 6 basis points today to a two-week low of 3.09 per cent, and are down 40 basis points in just a week, writes Joel Lewin. Yields move inversely to prices.

Italian 10-year yields are also touching a two-week low, down 5bps today and down 20bps over the last week.

Up until a week ago, UK and German 10-year debt were enjoying a storming rally that drove yields down to record lows as the ‘Leave’ campaign gathered momentum.

But over the last week, the pro-Brexit camp has stuttered and the ‘Remain’ campaign has regained some poise, pushing Gilts and Bunds on the back foot.

As UK voters put pen to paper today, the sell-off is gathering pace. Yields on 10-year Gilt have leapt 7bps to a three-week high of 1.38 per cent, up more than 30bps over the last week. Their equivalent maturity Bund yields have climbed 5bps today to a three-week high of 0.10 per cent.

Jamie Searle at Citi says these moves are likely to accelerate in the event of a ‘Remain’ vote.

He writes:

A “remain” outcome is likely to prompt a knee-jerk sell-off in global rates. We expect 10yr gilt yields to move back above 1.5% fairly quickly.

For euro markets, 10yr periphery spreads are likely to tighten as much as 30bp, in our view. Bunds are likely to back up to 0.1-0.2%, but this may be short-lived as squeeze risk reengages and takes Bunds negative again.

However, if the UK votes exit the EU, he says Gilt yields are likely to fall below 1 per cent, while peripheral yields could rise by more than 50bps “as political contagion and EU integrity risk is priced”.
