Spain and Italy bear brunt of Brexit stress

2016-06-24

The eurozone’s weaker member states are on course for their worst day of trading in history after Britain has voted to leave the EU and thrown the future of the bloc into doubt.

Spain’s Ibex index is now the biggest faller in the continent, declining by 12 per cent as we approach mid-afternoon trading.

The index is now on course to suffer its largest decline since it was launched in 1992. The sell-off has pushed the Ibex to its lowest level since the market tremors hit global markets in February, when Spanish equities hit a three-year low.

Banks have borne the brunt of the Brexit-induced stress, with Banco Santander down 23 percent, Caixabank 21 per cent, and Banco de Sabadell falling 21 per cent. The country’s financial system was forced into a €56.6bn bailout in 2012.

Spain’s woes have been matched by Italy – the eurozone’s third largest economy. The country’s FTSE MIB has tanked as much as 11 per cent, and is 10.3 per cent in the red at pixel time – also on course for its worst ever day.

However, with financials across Europe taking a hit today, sovereign bonds yields have retreated after jumping at the start of the morning.

Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year debt have fallen back to 1.59 per cent and 1.45 per cent respectively at pixel time, trading below their February 2016 highs.
