Cocoa traders brace for Brexit hit

2016-06-24

Cocoa traders are bracing themselves for a volatile session ahead of the open of trading at 9.30am this morning.

The commodity, is one of the few raw materials traded equally on both sides of the Atlantic in sterling in London and the US dollar in New York, writes Emiko Terazono.

The New York market opens 15 minutes later at 9.45am. Once London opens it could open about 5 per cent higher, said brokers.

Jonathan Parkman, co-head of agriculture at Marex Spectron said:

The London market is likely to open significantly higher. New York should be down 4 per cent in line with other US dollar denominated commodities. This means that London cocoa could go up 5 to 6 per cent this morning.
