US volatility gauge poised to rise on Brexit worries

2016-06-24

Futures contracts that aim to track Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge have risen higher as jitters set into markets amid uncertainty over whether the UK voted to remain in the EU.

The Vix index closed at 17.25 on Thursday but investors are still able to trade futures on the index during Thursday evening, and the contract has climbed to 19.15, close to its long term average of 20 – a marker for heightened volatility, writes Joe Rennison in New York.

It comes as the British pound sunk to $1.43 and benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to 1.61 per cent and currently sit at 1.66 per cent, a sign of investors seeking shelter from the market. Gold, another safe-haven asset, has risen 1.03 per cent to $1,269.
