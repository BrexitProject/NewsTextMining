US dollar falls as Brexit jitters fade

2016-06-23

The US dollar came under pressure in early morning trading in Asia after a survey by polling group YouGov predicted a “remain” victory in the UK’s EU membership referendum.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six trading partners, declined by 0.7 per cent in choppy action. The pressure for the dollar came as investors bid up the currencies of several major European countries on the heels of the YouGov survey that showed 52 per cent of voters favoured staying in the EU, while 48 per cent supported leaving.

The UK pound logged a particularly stunning performance, roaring higher by 0.7 per cent in the Friday morning session, after a 1.2 per cent advance in the prior day. Sterling is now up by 4.3 per cent on the week, Bloomberg data show. That would be the biggest rally since May 2009.

The common currency also advanced, rising 0.2 per cent against the dollar, as worries faded that a vote by the UK to leave the EU could deal a powerful blow across Europe.

Out of the major developed market currencies, the only two that were lower against the dollar were the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, both seen as safe havens that tend to perform well during turbulent times.
