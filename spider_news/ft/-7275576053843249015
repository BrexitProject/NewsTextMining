UK government borrowing higher than expected in May

UK government borrowing was slightly higher than expected in May while April’s figure has also been revised up by £1bn, marking a bad start to the new financial year for chancellor George Osborne after he missed his target last year.

Public sector net borrowing, excluding taxpayer-backed banks, came in at £9.7bn in May, which although a £400m decrease year-on-year, was higher than the £9.5bn forecast by economists, writes Nathalie Thomas.

An estimate of borrowing for April has also been revised higher, to £8.2bn from an initial forecast of £7.2bn and much higher than the £6.4bn that had originally been anticipated by economists.

Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said May’s overshoot “mainly reflects weaker year-over-year growth in tax receipts”, adding that the latest figures “provide just a taste of what Brexit would do to the health of the government’s finances”. However he warned that even if the UK votes to remain in the European Union, Mr Osborne “only has a slim chance of meeting his budget surplus goal”.

Borrowing, excluding the banks, reached £74.9bn in the last financial year, overshooting the chancellor’s target of £72.2bn.

But the chancellor may be cheered by the fact May’s borrowing figure was the lowest for that month since May 2007.

The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast borrowing this financial year to reach £55.5bn – a forecast that was revised up in the last Budget from £49.9bn. But the chancellor in March still insisted the UK was on track to return a budget surplus by 2020.

While borrowing might be coming down – albeit at a slower pace than hoped – debt is still rising. Public sector net debt – again excluding the taxpayer-backed banks – was £1.6 trillion at the end of May, equivalent to 83.7 per cent of GDP and a £49.6bn increase year-on-year, according to the Office for National Statistics.
