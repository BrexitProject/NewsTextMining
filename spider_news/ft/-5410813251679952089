US stock-index futures sink 2% in high volume

2016-06-24

US stock-index futures skidded deep into negative territory in elevated volume late on Thursday as investors digested a stream of headlines that called the outcome of the Brexit referendum into doubt.

The fall came as investors darted out of a variety of risk assets and the UK pound logged one of its biggest intraday falls on record.

At the same time, volume in the contracts between 6pm and 8:30pm New York time exceeded the total cumulative volume over the same period for every day this week. Over 185,000 contracts have been traded Thursday evening, compared to less than 70,000 contracts over the course of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for the same period, write Joe Rennison and Adam Samson in New York.
