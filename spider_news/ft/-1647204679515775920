Making decisions when uncertain

2016-06-17

Haikus are an ancient form of Japanese poetry that have recently become popular in English. By analysing the articles the Financial Times publishes every day with a computer programme, we have unearthed some accidental but powerful haikus.

The poems follow the form and style of a traditional Japanese haiku — typically a three-line observation about a fleeting moment involving nature with 17 syllables arranged in a 5–7–5 pattern.

There are a surprising number of these poetic forms buried inside the hundreds of articles the FT publishes every day, from stories as diverse as the columns of Martin Wolf to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.

Over the coming weeks we will share these haikus on FT.com and social media. We will also be encouraging readers to share their feedback.
