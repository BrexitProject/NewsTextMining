Sterling showing its nerves

2016-06-23

Sterling held firm overnight, buoyed by the latest signs that voters may be leaning towards remaining in the EU at today’s very tight vote. But it’s edging back down again now.

Kit Juckes at SocGen has had a stab at predicting what happens next:

A decision to leave the EU is bad for global risk sentiment, good for the yen, and bad for sterling, the euro and higher-beta currencies particularly central and Eastern European ones.

On a ‘Leave’ decision, we expect sterling to fall to $1.30-1.35 quickly and we look for an eventual fall to $1.20-1.25 The euro would suffer too, falling to $1.04-1.08 initially and potentially further over time. This takes the euro to £0.80-0.85. The yen would out-perform the dollar, with the dollar potentially breaking Y100 temporarily.

On a ‘Remain’ vote, moves ought to be slightly smaller given positioning. Sterling can trade to $1.50-1.55 and the euro test the last year’s high at $1.17, though if that breaks we could still see a further spike to $1.20.
