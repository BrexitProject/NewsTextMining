Trade will suffer from a squeeze on migration

2016-06-22

Sir, Most economists agree that one of the most profound economic impacts of a Brexit would be on trade. Nevertheless, previous reporting and analyses of the cost of a Brexit to the UK economy in terms of trade have underestimated the disruptive impact because they have overlooked the trade-reducing effect of a squeeze on migration. 

A Brexit would imply looser economic integration between the UK and EU. In addition to the trade barriers that would arise from leaving the single market, and possible negative trade policy effects, reduced migration could hamper the UK’s foreign trade. 

In addition to the large number of immigrants residing in the UK, the number of British people living abroad amounts to approximately 5.5m. Other EU countries host a substantial share of British expatriates. 

Numerous academic studies have demonstrated that migration facilitates trade. Both immigrants and emigrants contribute to building commercial bridges between their country of birth and their country of residence. They provide companies with market intelligence and access to networks.

The issue of migration in the Brexit discussion has focused on what migration means for the welfare system of the UK, security, and the overall economic influence of migration on the labour market, as well as public finances. However, a squeeze on migration could also negatively impact UK access to foreign and dynamic markets. This means that a Brexit could disrupt trade more than previously feared.
