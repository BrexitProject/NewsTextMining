Latest betting odds give Remain 76% chance

2016-06-22

Some 80 per cent of the £1m worth of bets placed through Betfair’s gambling exchange immediately after last night’s debate on EU membership were placed on a vote to remain.

The “BBC Great Debate” pitted Boris Johnson, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and energy minister Andrea Leadsom, representing the “Leave” camp, against Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Frances O’Grady, who are all in favour of remaining in the EU.

On the eve of the referendum, the odds being offered through Betfair’s exchange – which allows punters to bet against each other – are implying a 76 per cent chance of Britain voting to remain part of the EU, consistent with the day before. Last night’s vigorous debate has failed to move the betting odds.

The odds of a Brexit had shortened last week but there is now only an implied 24 per cent chance of the “Leave” camp prevailing, Betfair said (see chart above).

The biggest single bet placed so far is £315,000 on “remain”. Four further opinion polls are due to be published today before polling stations open on Thursday morning. Betting odds tend to differ – often dramatically – from opinion polls.

Naomi Totten of Betfair said:

Tuesday night’s debate saw very little significant movement in the odds, despite £1m being traded during and immediately after. Attention is now being drawn to the margin of victory for Remain, with between 50.01% and 55% the favourite on the vote percentage market.

William Hill is currently offering odds through its website of 2/9 that the UK will vote to remain in the EU implying a probability of almost 82 per cent.
