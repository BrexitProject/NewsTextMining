Brexiters are honouring Thales of Miletus

2016-06-16

Sir, Chris Giles (“ Economists’ rare unity highlights the perils of Brexit”, June 16) is correct in noting that by arguing against Brexit, economists themselves will be on the line, especially if a Brexit outcome turns out to be beneficial.

There are good reasons why the majority of economists do not favour Brexit. Noting that “the past is certain, the future obscure”, the ancient Greek scientist Thales of Miletus could not have imagined that Brexiters would be doing everything they can to “honour” his saying. Indeed, seven days before the referendum, their lack of preparation and/or (consistent) plans on what will be done if they win the vote has obscured the ability of voters to decide in a well-informed manner.

It is this lack of planning that makes me, perhaps naively, think that we will not know, at least for a generation, whether economists (including myself) were wrong this time around.
