Bank of England rate cut expectations jump after Brexit

2016-06-24

Economists and financial markets expect the Bank of England’s next move will be to cut interest rates after the UK unexpectedly voted to leave the EU.

The implied probability the BoE will cut rates by 25 basis point (0.25 percentage point) at its February 2017 meeting has jumped to nearly 75 per cent, soaring from the 17.5 per cent chance priced in before the referendum result.

A poll of 70 economists carried out by Reuters also expects the BoE’s next move to be a rate cut and puts the chances of a recession at 53 per cent this year.

The UK’s 10-year and 2-year bond yields – which are sensitive to changes in monetary policy – have both fallen to record lows on expectations of monetary easing. Yields on benchmark 10-year Gilts fell to as low as 1.089 per cent on Friday.

Analysts at Pimco also expect the BoE’s benchmark Bank rate to be slashed to zero, but think policymakers will avoid taking the plunge into negative territory in favour of more quantitative easing measures.

Pimco’s Mike Amey said:

The UK economy will be pulled lower by the uncertainty created by the referendum vote.

As a result, we expect the Bank of England to cut the official interest rate to zero from 0.5%. If it feels the need to do more, we expect a reintroduction of quantitative easing rather than a move to lower the official rate into negative territory

Earlier today, governor Mark Carney announced an additional £250bn in liquidity for commercial banks in the wake of the vote.

Mr Carney said the central bank would not “hesitate to take any additional measures required” to ensure financial stability is maintained following the vote.
