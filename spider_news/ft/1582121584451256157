Fast Asia Open: It begins

2016-06-22

Well, this is it, just about. It’s June 23 – Brexit referendum day – but investors in Asia still have hours to wait until voting booths open in the UK. Right about now, we still have roughly a day to wait until the first poll results start to emerge. So hang in there!

The UK’s vote on European Union membership is the only game in town today and Friday. For all your Brexit/Bremain needs, do check out the FT’s EU referendum landing page here, and note that we will also be running a live blog once polls open in Britain later today, which will continue into Friday (in Asia) with all the results and reaction.

Meanwhile, on referendum eve of sorts, sterling has grabbed the headlines, trading to its highest level of the year on Thursday. The pound was up as much as 0.9 per cent today at $1.4844. It is sitting close to that level now, up 0.8 per cent year-to-date against the US dollar.

The FTSE 100 rose 0.6 per cent on Wednesday. Elsewhere, European stocks added 0.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 eased 0.2 per cent.

Futures tip Japan’s Nikkei 225 to open flat this morning and for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 to ease 0.3 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was last tipped to open flat.

Today’s economic calendar is on the light side (Hong Kong times):
