Britain’s Brexit vote – the reaction from abroad

2016-06-24

No doubt pages and pages will be written over the next few days, weeks and months about how the “leave” camp snatched victory in the UK’s EU membership referendum and how the pollsters – once again – got it so wrong. But it is not only the British press that is reeling from the shock of the result. Here fastFT looks at press reaction from around the world. 

Le Figaro of France focuses on Brussels, which it reports, is in a “state of shock” and was attempting this morning to keep its composure in the face of an “irreparable jump into the unknown”.

Also in France, Les Echos claims the Europeans are tempted to delay post-Brexit negotiations to put pressure on London (see headline below). It writes:

The vast majority of economists are concerned about the enormous cost that a Brexit will represent for Great Britain.

But Les Echos does point out there is one profession at least that will benefit from a Brexit: lawyers

Because, as often is the case with divorces, that between the European Union and the UK will most likely be a judicial battle which can only make a fortune for legal professions

Frankfurter Allgemeine in Germany, as well as carrying articles about David Cameron’s resignation as UK prime minister, takes a look specifically at the future of Scotland. It writes that the Scots see their future in Europe and, following the Brexit referendum result, could hold a fresh independence vote.

Japan’s Nikkei is warning that the Brexit decision could lead to a back pedaling on corporate globalization as it underlined issues such as income gaps and job uncertainties.

Japanese company executives are showing huge interests on a decision that was made on the other side of the world not only because it has an impact on our financial market… They are feeling fears that corporate globalization might be more than just a short cut to growth, are becoming real.
