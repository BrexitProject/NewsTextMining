US stock rally loses steam

2016-06-20

US stocks pared back their gains into the close on Monday, but the S&P 500 still managed to clock its biggest one-day advance in nearly a month.

The S&P 500, which had advanced as much as 1.4 per cent earlier on Monday as concerns about Brexit eased, finished the day 0.6 per cent higher at 2,083.25 — notching its biggest one-day gain since May 25.

The latest polls showed the UK’s Remain camp had regained momentum ahead of Britain’s referendum on its EU membership this week. That in turn drove a move into risk assets pushing global stocks higher and prompting a sell-off in safe haven assets like Treasuries and gold.

While European markets posted strong gains, the US stock rally fizzled by the end of the day.

Analysts have warned that markets will remain volatile leading up to Thursday’s vote and that the slightest shift in polls could unnerve investors.

Moreover, while markets expect Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s semi-annual testimony to Congress — slated for tomorrow and Wednesday — to largely follow her comments following the central bank’s meeting last week, a change in that message could also impact markets.
