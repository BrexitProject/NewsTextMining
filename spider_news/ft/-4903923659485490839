Calm down dear – it’s not 1992 for sterling

2016-06-22

(Probably.)

That’s the conclusion of Deutsche Bank’s Alan Ruskin, who notes that when the UK left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992, sterling fell by some 17 cents against the dollar in a week, the biggest drop in sterling against the dollar since, well, the modern era of currencies trading began in the 1970s. Fun times.

Right now, the market is pricing in a 10 per cent chance that we see an even bigger drop. (For more on ‘what’s the worst that can happen?’ read this.)

He’s not convinced:

The UK referendum date is much better flagged than the pound’s exit from the ERM, where ‘the writing was only on the wall’ when the UK started raising base rates on the day of ejection, from 10% to 15% – levels that the real economy was never going to be able to sustain.

In 1992, we not only did not know the date when Sterling’s ERM band would break, but once it broke, the sterling equilibrium rate was regarded as favoring a much weaker pound. There were a huge number of positions caught on the wrong side that contributed to the 40 big figure collapse in sterling in the next 5 months.

This time around, we have long known the date, and while there is enormous gap risk on a Brexit, ‘offside positions’ and to a lesser degree valuation considerations will provide much less impetus for further immediate sterling downside acceleration.

In addition, central banks around the world are ready for the worst this time around, he added. So…

Is a potential Brexit response bigger than the 1992 sterling ERM exit, when measured in sterling/dollar terms? On a one week reaction, and even on a six-month time horizon, very probably not.

*Probably.*
