Gold fails to trade in wake of new poll

2016-06-23

Hello? Gold?

Gold has failed to trade in the wake of a YouGov poll showing a lead for a remain vote in the UK referendum, writes Henry Sanderson.

The last gold trade happened at 09:58 pm, according to Reuters. That’s in contrast to oil, which rose to $51 a barrel to a two-week high.

“The market is likely to wait for something firmer which is not expected for hours,” Jim Steel, an analyst at HSBC in New York, said.

New York is coming to the end of its trading day, while the gold night-trading market in China has already closed.

Gold last traded at $1,256 a troy ounce.
