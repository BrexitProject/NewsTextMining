Asian markets continue global Remain rally

2016-06-21

Asian markets were still basking in a sharp improvement in sentiment ahead of the UK’s European Union membership referendum on Thursday.

Japan’s broad Topix was up 0.4 per cent while the Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was 0.3 per cent higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.5 per cent.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up half of one per cent, a third consecutive session of gains that makes for the longest winning streak since the start of April. The technology-focused Shenzhen Composite climbed 0.5 per cent.

Global equities posted solid gains on Monday after weekend poll results showed the voters in favour of the UK leaving the European Union had lost some of their lead over the Remain camp. The big beneficiary of that rebalancing was the British pound, which closed 2.4 per cent higher on Monday for its biggest one-day gain since December 15 2008.

In Asia on Tuesday, sterling took a breather and was down 0.3 per cent at $1.4653. Yesterday’s gain has trimmed the currency’s decline this year to half of one per cent.

The FTSE 100 rallied 3 per cent on Monday, its best one-day gain since February and European stocks gained about 3.3 per cent. Some of the exuberance had died down by the time US investors took over, with the S&P 500 closing 0.6 per cent higher.

One event that that could draw some attention today is Janet Yellen’s Congressional testimony. The Fed chair is not expected to deviate markedly from her press conference remarks following the central bank’s decision last week to keep interest rates on hold and as policymakers delayed their rate rise expectations for 2017 and 2018. That makes it harder for Ms Yellen to surprise markets today, however the outlook for US interest rates is likely to come back into focus as Brexit concerns subside.

The US dollar index, a measure of the US currency measured against a basket of global peers, remains under pressure and was down 0.1 per cent at 93.543 on Tuesday, and on track for a fifth consecutive day of declines. Gold, which is sensitive to US interest rate expectations, was down 0.2 per cent at $1,287.65, but has softened as concerns about Brexit retreated slightly and investors shunned haven assets.

The yen was 0.1 per cent weaker today at ¥‎104.07 per dollar and on track to break a seven-session losing streak.

Government bonds in Japan and Australia were also out of favour on Tuesday.

Oil prices also benefited from the general improvement in risk appetite in markets on Monday, but had eased in Asia today. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was down 0.5 per cent at $50.42 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 0.3 per cent at $49.20.
