US stocks sink as Brexit vote roils global markets

2016-06-24

US equities tumbled by more than 2 per cent as Wall Street joined a global flight to safety sparked by a surprise vote by the UK to part ways with the EU.

The sell-off echoes steep declines across global equity markets: The pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 plunged 6.9 per cent, while most Asian exchanges faced steep drops.

“The UK’s momentous decision to leave the EU brings long-lasting political and economic consequences,” BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager told its clients, adding that “we expect the UK divorce to be messy, drawn out and costly”.

The tumult was particularly pronounced in the currency markets, where the UK pound tumbled as much as 11 per cent in its sharpest drop on records that go back to the 1970s.

The Vix index, a measure of expected S&P 500 volatility over the next month, spiked by 40 per cent in its biggest increase since August 2015 in a sign investors may expect a sharp rise in equity-market volatility in the near-term as well.

Meanwhile, investors dashed into safe havens: The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of the bond’s price, plummeted to its lowest level since 2012, while the US dollar posted one of its biggest rallies on record, and gold prices shot higher.

The intense trading prompted messages of assurance from global central banks, with the Federal Reserve saying shortly before the opening bell in New York that it was prepared to provide the financial system with dollar liquidity if the markets lock-up.

Still, BlackRock said that the “indiscriminate selling could translate into opportunities” for investors who have the confidence to dip into the markets.

“US and Asia markets are only marginally affected by the UK’s exit from the EU, and are supported by a mix of easy monetary policy and economic growth,” the New York-based group said.
