Australian markets lower just before lunch

2016-06-24

The mood is as intense on Australian dealing floors as those elsewhere, reports Jamie Smyth from Sydney.

Daniel Been, a currency strategist at ANZ Bank in Sydney, who has been manning his desk since 5.30am, said he was swamped.

Liquidity was as expected, he said but “any further signs of a close count will mean that there are fewer offers for US dollars and as such any disappointments are being amplified [in the market moves].”

Local media report the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned the government an exit “could unleash market swings in Europe with the risk of contagion spreading to other markets, including in Australia”.

Exporters were watching the vote particularly closely, dealers said. There has been a pick-up in hedging in recent days against the risk, however low it looked at the time ,of an “Out” vote.

In April the pound hit a 15-month high against the weak Aussie dollar at A$0.54, but dropped to A$0.49 last month as Brexit expectations rose. It was being see-sawed around on Friday, but stood at A$0.526 as Sydney dealers ate lunch at their desks.

Like everyone else, traders follow cable, as sterling-dollar is nicknamed, far more closely than the local rates.

“For export clients its been absolutely crucial,” said Ray Attrill global co-head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, who has had a lot of calls from clients in the past few days. “If you can lock in at about $1.50 today and maybe $1.35 tomorrow if its an Out vote, what would you do?”

The S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.1 per cent just before lunchtime in Sydney.
