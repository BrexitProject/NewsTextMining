UK mid-caps: pounded

2016-06-24

Businesses adapt. The price of oil quadrupled in the early 1970s. Within a decade technology, capital and enterprise had developed new sources of supply from the North Sea, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico — and worked out ways to use less energy. But in between, there was volatility, disruption and uncertainty. It will be the same with Brexit.

In the longer term, UK-focused businesses will weather the economic shock of withdrawing from the EU. Life will go on. First, though, there will be pain. The red digits on traders’ screens today give some indication of where it is likely to be felt severely. The UK’s future status vis-à-vis trade and the movement of people will not become apparent for some time. The impact on currency, borrowing costs and confidence will be seen more quickly. So worry about those companies that are indebted, linked to the domestic economic cycle and most heavily exposed to currency risk.

Non-food retailers, already grappling with structural upheaval and domestic challenges such as the national minimum wage, look exposed. Most have no overseas exposure of any consequence. Many of their wares are made in countries whose currencies are linked to the US dollar. Car dealers, selling big-ticket (often imported) items on credit that could get more expensive, will also be worried — especially as their shares have been on a tear recently. Housebuilders, whose shares trade at lofty multiples, may also suffer from less confidence.

There is shelter in the usual places. Dearer imports from a weak pound may push up inflation. If so, then utilities — whose regulated returns are index-linked, and whose costs and revenues are largely in sterling — will not complain. Specialist engineers and others with substantial overseas revenues (Burberry springs to mind) may relish sterling at a 30-year low. Amid the uncertainty, there will be opportunities, as well as challenges.
