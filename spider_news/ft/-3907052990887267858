Fast Asia Open: TGIF

2016-06-16

It could be with some relief that investors in Asia will welcome the final day of a volatile trading week, with late, overnight moves offering some respite from the bluster of recent days.

Government bond yields in Germany and the UK hit record lows during trading, pushed around by demand for the relative safety of government debt and uncertainty around Britain’s EU membership referendum, respectively. The US 10-year Treasury yield hit its lowest point in almost four years, but reversed course to close Thursday slightly higher.

Currencies remained a major focus for investors, with the yen’s surge to a 22-month high against the dollar on Thursday as the Bank of Japan refrained from easing monetary policy firmly in the spotlight.

The past 24 hours have seen the central banks of the US, Japan, Switzerland and United Kingdom keep monetary policy on hold.

The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.2 per cent, while European stocks had early closed 0.4 per cent lower.

The less risk-averse stance in global financial markets came after campaigning over the June 23 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union was halted following the death of British MP Jo Cox. The British pound, which has been a focal point for investor concerns about Brexit, reversed early declines following the news.

Futures tip Japan’s Nikkei 225 to rise 0.6 per cent today, and for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 to gain 0.7 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was last tipped to gain 0.2 per cent.
