Paddy Power slides on Australian setback

2016-06-23

A London market rally left Paddy Power Betfair behind on Thursday on unexpected news of a tax increase in Australia.

South Australia’s state government announced plans to introduce a 15 per cent betting tax by mid-2017, charged by where the bets are placed rather than where the bookmaker is located.

Analysts saw little impact to earnings given just 7 per cent of Australia’s population is in the Southern district. Barclays estimated a 1 per cent cut to Paddy Power’s 2017 operating earnings.

The greater worry, Barclays said, was if Southern Australia sets a precedent for other states to introduce a Point of Consumption tax. 

A recent decision to ban in-play betting suggests Australia is taking decisions that will impact UK operators, the broker argued.

Taxing Paddy Power’s Australia-wide revenue would cut 2017 earnings by 10 per cent, Barclays forecast. The shares slid 4.6 per cent to £87.00.

Referendum rumours and speculation made for a volatile day in the wider market. 

The FTSE 100 jumped as much as 1.9 per cent in early trading to hit a two-month high, then nearly erased the gain, and rallied again in late deals to close up 1.2 per cent, ahead 76.91 points to 6,338.10. 

The FTSE 250, considered a closer barometer of the UK economy, rose 1.7 per cent for its highest close of 2016 so far.

British Airways owner IAG bounced 3.6 per cent to 528p. Brexit risk has made IAG one of the airline sector’s worst performers this year, even though it is expected to deliver near-50 per cent profit growth this year, said Goodbody, which repeated “buy” advice. 

“Our above market consensus forecast for the next few years remains firmly in place following a recent catch-up with the company, with our 2017 forecast 11 per cent above consensus mainly on the expected timing and expansion of the group’s cost-saving programmes,” Goodbody added.

InterContinental Hotels rose 2.7 per cent to £27.23, also helped by US lodging data showing revenue per available room — the industry’s favoured benchmark — up 3.3 per cent year-on-year last week. 

Worries about weak US corporate demand have been weighing on InterContinental in the run-up to its first-half results due in early July.

Chemicals maker Elementis slipped a further 1 per cent to 206.6p on the back of Wednesday’s profit warning. 

Export markets for Elementis’s US-based chromium business are “under structural pressure” as rivals in Russia and Kazakhstan capitalise on the dollar’s strength to push down prices and gain market share, Berenberg said. 

Premier Farnell edged 0.3 per cent to 165.5p after Elliott, the activist hedge fund, raised its stake in the electronics distributor to 2.6 per cent. 

Elliott was adding to the 1 per cent holding it bought earlier in June, the day Premier announced a 165p-a-share agreed bid from Dätwyler of Switzerland.
