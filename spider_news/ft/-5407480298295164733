Pound turns positive as European trading begins

2016-06-21

The British pound has flicked into positive territory as European investors get their feet under the desk.

Sterling had been as much as 0.4 per cent weaker during the Asian session, but has made a late surge, and has jumped as much as 0.2 per cent to $1.4726 as the European session begins, writes Peter Wells. At pixel time, it’s up 0.1 per cent at $1.4711.

For those rubbing their eyes in the morning light, keep rubbing your eyes. While you were sleeping, the pound ruled off on a 2.4 per cent gain for the Monday session, its biggest one-day advance since December 15 2008, and its third-biggest jump of the past 10 years. Yowsers. We do have a post on it from earlier, but assuming you won’t scroll down, here are the tables again.

Here are the one-day gains.

The other great accomplishment was that the Friday-Monday spurt ranked as the fourth-largest two-day gain for the pound, according to our analysis of daily Bloomberg data back to 1971. Double-yowsers.

* A previous version of the post incorrectly said the Friday-Monday spurt was the seventh-largest on record. Had to recheck a spreadsheet – it’s the fourth-largest. Apologies.
