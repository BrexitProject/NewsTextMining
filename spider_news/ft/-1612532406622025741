How Brexit could affect Asian currencies

2016-06-22

A possible Brexit will prove negative to most Asian currencies with China’s renminbi and India’s rupee suffering the most, according to an estimate by Malaysia’s Maybank.

The Japanese yen is the only major Asian currency expected to gain if British voters decide to leave the European Union tomorrow, with a potential to rise by 11.7 per cent against the dollar, Maybank analysts say.

The yuan and rupee, meanwhile, could lose up to 5.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. A Brexit decision could put pressure on China’s central bank which last month set the renminbi at a five year low on the back of a rising dollar.

South Korea’s won, Philippines’ peso and the Malaysian ringgit are also set to slide. Maybank analysts said:

These economies are most susceptible to risk appetite and risk-off could see flight to safety away from assets of these economies to higher quality assets

The Singapore dollar and Indonesia rupiah are to be among the least impacted on a Leave vote, Maybank said. This is because:

the former [is] seen as a safer haven among ASEAN currencies, while the latter has so far been buffered by portfolio and direct investment flows as sentiments towards Indonesia has improved with the reformist policies of President [Joko Widodo].
