Poland’s Kaczynski calls for new EU treaty after Brexit

2016-06-24

The head of Poland’s ruling party has called for a new EU treaty that devolves more power to national capitals, blaming the British referendum result on a desire for greater integration in Brussels.

“The principle of subsidiarity should be clearly defined, because today it is not observed,” said Mr Kaczynski, who pulls the strings of Poland’s government, reports Henry Foy in Warsaw. 

“We need a new European treaty”, he said.

“One [EU] attitude is more and more of the Union. This attitude is to blame for ever greater crises, such as Brexit. Federalist concepts lead to unhappiness.”

Mr Kaczynski’s broadly eurosceptic and nationalist Law and Justice party came to power in Warsaw in November, and has been in conflict with Brussels for most of its time in office.
