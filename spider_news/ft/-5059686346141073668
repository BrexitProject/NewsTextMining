Aston Martin to go ahead with £200m Wales plant

2016-06-24

The boss of Aston Martin insists that Brexit will have no impact on the company’s plans to spend £200m on a new plant in Wales.

Aston will open a new factory in Wales to produce its DBX, an SUV-sized vehicle that it hopes will expand its customer base internationally, reports Peter Campbell in London.

Although the luxury marque exports the vast majority of its cars, it does not have any cars in the larger vehicle segment, which is the fastest growing part of the industry.

Chief executive Andy Palmer said the company’s strategy of expanding its global reach and unveil a new line up of cars this decade was designed to protect it from political and economic “earthquakes”.

“If anything, Brexit reinforces that strategy,” he said, insisting that the project would go ahead without delays or changes.

“If trade barriers come up we will need to increase our efficiencies,” he said, but said the company was already on a path to increase the efficiency of its vehicle production by 30 per cent.

But he added the slump in the pound would increase the competitiveness of the group’s exports.

Aston Martin has the capacity to produce 8,000 cars at its current plant in Gaydon, where it employs 1,800 people.
