US stocks rise with Brexit, Yellen in focus

2016-06-21

US stocks climbed for the second straight day as investors closely eyed developments on the UK’s Brexit campaigns and awaited remarks from the head of the Federal Reserve.

As British citizens prepare to vote this Thursday on whether the country should remain part of the European Union, volatility across the financial markets has increased.

Indeed, the pound was up by as much as 0.6 per cent against the US dollar at session highs on Tuesday, but slid into the red after a poll from Survation showed the ‘Leave’ camp narrowed its gap against ‘Remain’.

Market strategists warned that turbulence may heat up as the Brexit vote nears, particularly given the unprecedented nature of the situation that makes it difficult for traders to handicap.

Investors will also keep close tabs on commentary by Janet Yellen, who will begin her two-day appearance before US Congress on Tuesday.

The Fed chief’s remarks come after the central bank surprised Wall Street last week by significantly ratcheting down its forecast for the policy rate over the long term, something that many economists interpreted as suggesting the US economy may face deeper structural issues than policymakers had expected.

Elsewhere, US crude oil prices declined by 1.9 per cent to $48.40 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.1 per cent to $49.59 a barrel on a report about a potential ceasefire in Nigeria that would help alleviate a supply disruption there.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of the bond’s price, fell 1.4 basis points to 1.673 per cent. Gold slid $17.02, or 1.3 per cent, to $1,273. a troy ounce.
