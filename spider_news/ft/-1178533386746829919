Car sales to drop 20% if UK enters recession

2016-06-24

Demand for new cars in the UK may fall by a fifth if the country enters a recession, a City analyst has warned in the first reaction from the automotive industry to a likely Brexit vote.

Appetite for new cars falls by 20 per cent in a “typical” downturn, Stuart Pearson, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in an early morning note to clients, writes Peter Campbell, motor industry correspondent. 

Shares in Japanese car makers with major manufacturing centres in Britain have fallen by around 7 per cent since the markets opened.

Nissan, Toyota and Honda between them make 800,000 cars a year at their plants in Sunderland, Deeside and Swindon.

Mr Pearson said that he projected “Significant sector underperformance” among automakers, with Peugeot Citroen, BMW and Fiat Chrysler are among the companies most likely to be affected by the decision.

He noted that 13 per cent of Peugeot’s sales are into the UK, and the French car maker is the most heavily exposed listed manufacturer to the pound.

BMW has 12 per cent of its sales in the UK. Fiat is the most heavily indebted car maker, with more than €5bn of net debt, leaving it vulnerable, he added.

Concerns around other countries’ membership of the EU may also weigh of FCA’s shares, he added.

Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest car maker producing more than 500,000 vehicles a year, is not a listed company as it is owned by Tata Motors in India.
