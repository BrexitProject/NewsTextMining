US stock futures jump after S&P rallies 1.3%

2016-06-23

US stock-index futures climbed late on Thursday, suggesting the S&P 500 may add to its 1.3 per cent surge when its opens on Friday.

A rise in the S&P 500 would put the benchmark stock-market index within easy range of the record closing high it hit last May, but has failed to regain despite several attempts in 2016.

Volume is often very light so early in the futures trading session, with activity generally heating up in the hours leading up to the opening bell at 9:30am ET. However, the move echoes a broad risk rally that picked up steam after a private poll projected the “remain” camp will edge out “leave” in the UK’s referendum over whether it should part ways with the EU.

Indeed, the pound, seen as a proxy for investor sentiment on the vote, climbed above the $1.50 mark for the first time this year, and was set for its sharpest weekly advance in more than seven years. On the other side of the spectrum, traditional haven currencies, like the Japanese yen faced selling pressure.

“The market has certainly voted that they believe we are going to stay,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade.

In addition to the Brexit vote, investors also cheered the latest round of Federal Reserve stress tests that showed the biggest US banks would be weather a severe economic storm imagined by the central bank to tests defenses. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, was up by 1 per cent in after hours trading, Bank of America climbed 1.3 per cent, Citigroup jumped 2.9 per cent and Wells Fargo added 1 per cent.
