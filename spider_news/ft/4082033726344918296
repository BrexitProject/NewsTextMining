Britain’s pro-EU camp has a one point lead against the ‘Leave’ camp in a new poll putting Remain on 45 per cent.

The phone poll from Survation and IG carried out on June 20 did, however, show a 2 point increase for ‘Leave’ to 44 per cent, helping the pound fall to $1.4707 after the release.

UK 10-year gilt yields also traded higher to 1.267 per cent after the poll.

The FT’s ‘poll of polls’ tracker has Leave one point ahead as of Tuesday’s polls.
