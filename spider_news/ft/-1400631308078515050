Yen, bonds and gold: Havens rally as doubts over Brexit outcome grow

2016-06-24

The Japanese yen, Treasury bonds and gold, used by investors as shelters during times of tumult, were all rallying as results from the UK’s EU referendum painted a mixed picture about the outcome.

Private polling initially suggested the Remain camp had a modest lead. But as regional results have trickled out, that premise has been thrown into doubt, writes Adam Samson. The news caused intense volatility in many parts of the financial market. Indeed, the UK pound sustained its steepest intraday fall since 2008, according to Bloomberg data.

The ructions sent investors scurrying for safety. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the bond’s price, skidded to 1.68 per cent, after closing the previous session at 1.746 per cent.

“This is just an appetizer,” said Giovanni Pillitteri, global head of foreign exchange trading at GTS, an electronic market maker. “If the vote remains so split, [the pound] is going to be even more volatile.”

The dollar fell against the yen by 1.1 per cent to 104.99 in tumultuous Asian trading. Gold prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 per cent to $1,268.40 a troy ounce, shedding gains from earlier in the day.

Market strategists expected volatility heading into Thursday evening as many groups, ranging from UBS to the CME Group, issued notes to clients indicating trading could be affected by large swings.
