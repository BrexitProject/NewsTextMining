So what happens next in markets? Some thoughts…

2016-06-23

It looks, tentatively, like Remain has won in the EU referendum, giving sterling a bump higher. Here’s what some analysts and investors, burning the midnight oil, make of it:

Benjamin Mandel, multi-asset solutions, JP Morgan Asset Management:

There will be more relief on the dollar as risk-off sentiment subsides. More relief to US financial conditions generally. It does feed into US monetary policy… In some respects it makes it more probable that policymakers kick into action this year.

There are a few areas where the response is more meaningful. One is the short end of the UK yield curve. There you have a situation where markets are anticipating a long time til the next rate hike from the BOE – priced to be some time in 2017. A Remain would be a modest boost to UK growth… That would factor into the BOE’s thinking over the next few months. It could change peoples’ minds in terms of the near term policy outlook for the UK.

David Bloom, head of currency research for HSBC:

Basically the market has reacted, there’s a 90 per cent chance that there’s a Remain victory, so the big shock could be the other way.

Jeffrey Tabak, co-chief executive of Miller Tabak:

This was to be expected. The only issue is how much further [sterling] can go. On what grounds is the pound going to continue to rally to the upside? It’s hard to see how this good news of a Remain [victory] isn’t already baked into the market and it will be hard to see an acceleration beyond short covering.

BNP Paribas reckons the UK currency still has fuel in the tank:

An update of our positioning analysis suggests that some market participants had reduced sterling shorts heading into the voting but overall positioning remained substantially short, suggesting scope for a further relief rally in the pound in the event a “remain” vote is confirmed.
