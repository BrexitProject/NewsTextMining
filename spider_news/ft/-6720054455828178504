Donald Trump: ‘The UK took back control’

2016-06-24

Donald Trump has welcomed Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, saying “the UK took back control, it was a great thing”. Arriving at Turnberry in Scotland, where the property mogul has spent £200m to renovate the historic golf course in Ayrshire, he said:

It was a very historic vote.

He also praised the judgement of the British people, writes Murad Ahmed in Turnberry.

“They took their country back… people around the world are angry,” he said.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee arrived in Scotland on Friday morning, landing at Turnberry in a helicopter bearing his name and wearing a white hat emblazoned with his slogan “Make America Great Again”.

During the referendum campaign, some Leave activists had echoed some of Mr Trump’s best lines during the debate, adopting the slogan “Make Britain Great Again.”

Asked how the UK’s leaders could bring together a divided country, Mr Trump said simply:

It will heal.

During a state visit earlier this year, US President Barack Obama had intervened in the Brexit debate, warning the UK would be at the “back of the queue” to negotiate a trade deal if it left the EU.

But Mr Trump had been a rare international political figure – alongside the likes of the French National Front leader Marine Le Pen – to encourage Britons to vote to leave.

There were no prominent Scottish politicians to welcome his arrival, who were instead digesting the outcome of the EU referendum.

The ruling Scottish National Party was left to ponder whether to trigger a new independence referendum, just two years after Scots voted to stay within the UK. All 32 Scottish local authorities voted to remain in the EU in Thursday’s poll but their will has been overturned by English votes.
