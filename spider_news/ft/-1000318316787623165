Fast Asia Open: UK’s EU referendum week begins

2016-06-19

It’s a pretty important week for markets as far as risk events are concerned, with the UK’s referendum on European Union membership taking place on Thursday.

Polls over the the weekend showed a slight swing to Remain, with the pro-Brexit camp’s edging ahead in previous weeks having made markets nervous. This morning, the British pound has jumped 1.1 per cent in Asia, matching its Friday advance.

Investors are also likely to keep an eye on India, after it was revealed Raghuram Rajan, the country’s central bank governor, would not continue in his role after his three-year term ends on September 4. His exit is being touted as potentially damaging to efforts to reform policy.

Wall Street ended a volatile week with a decline on Friday, as the S&P 500 sank one-third of one per cent, while European stocks gained 1.1 per cent.
