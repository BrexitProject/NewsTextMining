Another vehicle like Trump and Le Pen

2016-06-21

Sir, Everything that you wrote in “ Britain should vote to stay in the European Union” (editorial, June 16) is true but, in a broader sense, irrelevant. You seem to have missed the fact that Brexit has become a vehicle (like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen) for venting the anger of people who have been left behind by the new economic order. When large numbers of people cannot answer affirmatively to the questions: “Are you better off now than you were 20 years ago?” and “Do you think your children will live better than you have?”, change is destined to come.

The old liberal world order is dying because the cost-benefit ratio for the average person in the western world is now negative. Telling your readers that the vote must be Remain will do nothing to alter this calculus.
