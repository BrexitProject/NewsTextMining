UK banks: ouch

2016-06-24

This is not 2008. Major bank shares have fallen by the most since the global financial crash — but there is no liquidity crisis. UK banks have three times more cash and high quality assets than they did back then, according to Bernstein, less short-term funding requirements and more than twice the tangible equity. Bank credit default swaps are not registering panic. 

So it is not all bad. It is, however, mostly bad. It is not surprising that a Brexit vote has sent UK bank stocks down by a fifth. The big British retail banks — Barclays, Lloyds, RBS — all rose by more than a tenth in the two weeks leading up to the referendum in expectation of a “Bremain” boost and better-than-anticipated second-quarter results. The market got it wrong.

The bull case for UK banks had been simple: they have robust retail units which, in many cases, make double-digit returns on equity. Earnings, the argument went, would increase as banks continued to hive off non-core assets (RBS and Barclays) and fines for past misbehaviour (Lloyds) receded.

Profitability at those retail businesses will now come under pressure. Banks make money by lending at rates higher than those they borrow at. The fact that the yield curve has flattened — 10-year gilt yields are at record lows — implies that net interest margins will remain wafer thin. What about volumes? Credit cards, buy-to-let mortgages and personal loans have been the sweet spots in the UK banking market. Lower confidence and GDP growth will hurt all three.

The counterargument is that a pro-business government in an open economy will do everything it can to support the banks. Some of the biggest shares in the sector are now trading at a steep discount to book value. But a prime minister has resigned and the one unequivocal winner so far, Nigel Farage, bashes big banks and companies for being too pro-EU. Brave investors are unlikely to be rewarded in the short term.
