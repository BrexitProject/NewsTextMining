Take comfort in coffee from Brexit, football brawls and populists

2016-06-16

Populist politicians rising in the polls. Global investors shuddering at the prospect of Brexit. Football fans brawling on the Riviera. 

If the news is getting you down, maybe it’s time for a coffee. One scrap of optimism in a week of gloom-inducing headlines is the official finding that a caffeine habit may not be as bad for you as you thought. 

After assessing 1,000 studies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has scrapped its previous guidance and said there is no evidence of coffee causing cancer — and, indeed, that it may even protect against some types of the disease. 

It’s not the only recent study to highlight possible health (and safety) benefits from coffee. Other research, published in reputable journals, suggests that — among other possible upsides — coffee may reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes, dementia and Parkinson’s disease, and protect against cirrhosis of the liver. 

There is also some evidence — unlikely to surprise anyone — that long-distance lorry drivers who drink coffee are significantly less likely to crash.

Of course, that doesn’t make it possible to knock back double espressos all day without ill effect. Coffee is also thought to cause a mild increase in blood pressure. It is definitely not a good idea for children, and requires caution from pregnant women and those with hypertension. And some of the health benefits that researchers have observed appear only when drinking amounts that would play havoc with sleeping patterns. 

But given the admonitory chorus from nutrition experts on the perils associated with fat, sugar and other dietary hazards — to say nothing of the rather bigger risks facing the world economy and political order — we should take comfort where we can.
