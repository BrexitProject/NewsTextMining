Gold prices slide in risk-on trade

2016-06-20

Gold began the week on the backfoot after opinion polls on Britain’s EU referendum showed rising support for the Remain camp taking the wind out of the recent rally in safe haven assets.

Gold, which fell as much as 1.6 per cent on Monday, pared back its losses to trade 1 per cent lower at $1,285.89 an ounce in late morning trading. Waning fears about the risk of a possible ‘Brexit’ alongside investor positioning contributed to the drag on the precious metal.

The sell-off is “very related to perceptions of the probability of Brexit, but there is also a lot of speculative length in gold, some of which we think is getting a bit nervous,” Paul Horsnell, commodities strategist at Standard Chartered, said.

The bank’s latest Money Manager Positioning index for gold stood at 95.3. A reading of 100, on a scale of minus 100 to 100, would represent the largest money market net long as a percentage of open interest in the past five years. And that compares with a reading of minus 100 as of mid-December, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.

“It has taken just six months for money manager positioning to switch from maximum bearishness to almost maximum bullishness, and we think that process has now almost run its course,” Mr Horsnell added. He said if the UK votes to remain in the EU there is potential further downside for gold.

Monday’s decline comes after gold prices had advanced 7 per cent this month to Friday— briefly rising above the $1,300 an ounce level, lifted by Brexit fears and after the Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance. The Fed’s move to leave interest rates unchanged and its decision to pare back interest rate forecasts for 2017 and 2018 also benefited gold, which carries no yield.

Moreover, the Fed’s decision also weakened the US dollar — the currency in which gold is denominated — making the precious metal cheaper for foreign buyers.
