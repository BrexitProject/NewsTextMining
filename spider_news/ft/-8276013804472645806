Oil pares losses but still down 5% for the day

2016-06-24

Oil regained some of its footing following a sharp sell-off early Friday but the commodity’s two main gauges still ended the day 5 per cent lower amid the global flight from risk after Britons voted to leave the EU.

A day after a week long rally helped push it back above $50 a barrel, Brent crude, the international benchmark settled 4.9 per cent lower at $48.41.

Its US counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, also ended the day down by a similar amount at $47.64 a barrel.

Concerns over the potential financial fallout of a Brexit – which some economists say could push the UK into a recession – and its wider impact on global growth prompted investors to dump stocks and growth-dependent commodities such as oil and seek refuge in haven assets such as gold, utilities stocks and high grade government bonds.

“The passage of Brexit ushers in an at least temporary period of heightened global financial market and economic uncertainty and a likely stronger dollar,” said Maury N. Harris, an economist at UBS.

Friday’s losses put the two benchmarks back in the red for the week. They also took some of the steam out of a rally that helped push oil prices up more than 80 per cent from the 12 year lows reached in January.

A resurgent dollar and slower global economic growth is likely keep the oil rally in check in the near term. A boost in the currency crimps the appeal of the commodity to foreign buyers since it’s priced in the dollar.
