Wall Street ‘fear gauge’ surges 40%

2016-06-24

A widely watched measure of expectations for US equity volatility spiked on Friday by its widest margin since last August after the UK’s vote to leave the EU ignited a global sell-off.

The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility over the next 30 days, rallied by 42.4 per cent to 24.4, above its long-term average of 20, suggesting investors see a sustained rise in turbulence in the short-term.

The striking advance by the so-called Wall Street fear gauge comes as S&P 500 futures suggested the broad-market barometer may kick off the trading session down as much as 4 per cent when the opening bell rings in New York at 9:30am ET.

The unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum sparked ructions in many other corners of the financial market as well, with the UK pound collapsing as much as much as 11.1 per cent in its worst day since records began in 1971. Equity bourses across the globe faced intense selling as well, with the pan-European Euro Stoxx 600 plunging 7.2 per cent.

“While central banks will act quickly to maintain market functioning, we judge the likely implications for market pricing to be large, broad-based and rapid,” Peter Oppenheimer, global chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, underscoring the angst over the vote.

Safe havens, meanwhile, were in vogue, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond sinking by 25.4 basis points to under 1.5 per cent as traders bid-up the asset. The Japanese yen rallied 3.8 per cent against the US dollar.
