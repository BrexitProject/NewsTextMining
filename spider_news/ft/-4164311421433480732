Barclays limits electronic FX orders on referendum day

2016-06-23

Barclays has stopped accepting some foreign exchange orders on its electronic trading platform and is instead transferring them to voice brokers because of increased volatility in currency markets caused by the UK referendum on EU membership.

The pound has already been moving around sharply in response to the latest opinion polls and analysts expect that if the UK votes for “Brexit” it could trigger a double-digit decline in sterling against the US dollar and the euro, writes Martin Arnold, Banking editor. 

Barclays said it had stopped accepting new stop-loss foreign exchange orders on its Barx electronic platform from 7am on Thursday, when the polls opened in the UK referendum, and was transferring them to manual voice execution.

The change is likely to last until at least Friday.

The bank said: “Our global sales, trading and research teams will be helping clients navigate markets throughout the night and post the EU referendum decision by delivering a normal service for our clients at all times as far as market conditions allow.”

When the Swiss franc unexpectedly appreciated last year, investors suffered heavy losses and some blamed banks for not giving them the best prices on their stop-loss orders on electronic trading platforms.
