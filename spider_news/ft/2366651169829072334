Asian markets cautious ahead of UK’s EU referendum

2016-06-23

Asian markets were treading cautiously ahead of the UK’s referendum today on whether to stay in the European Union, but polls showing support for the Remain camp helped push the British pound to its highest level of 2016.

UK voters will head to the polls toward the end of the Asian trading session today, with the first batch of results expected to trickle forth before regional markets trade on Friday.

Trading this week has been dominated by the recovery of the Remain campaign. Polls at the weekend showing waning momentum for the Leave camp boosted global market sentiment. On Monday, the pound staged its biggest one-day rise since December 2008, while equities rallied and investors spurned the relative safety of government bonds.

Sterling hit a 2016 high of $1.4844 in Asia today, before easing slightly to be 0.7 per cent higher at $1.4816. The currency is now sitting 0.5 per cent higher against the dollar year-to-date, and was stronger against all other global currencies today. The yen was worst off against the pound, down by 1 per cent, followed by the Swiss franc, down 0.8 per cent, US dollar, and New Zealand dollar, down 0.5 per cent.

Japan’s broad Topix was up 0.4 per cent, while the Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng were each up 0.2 per cent. On the mainland, China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.1 per cent and the Shenzhen Composite was 0.2 per cent higher.

Overnight, the FTSE 100 closed 0.6 per cent higher, its fourth-straight day of gains. European stocks added about 0.4 per cent while the S&P 500 staged a late sell-off to end 0.2 per cent lower.

Reflecting the still-nervous atmosphere in markets, the CBOE Vix volatility index closed 15.6 per cent higher on Wednesday to four-month high of 21.17. Government bond markets, which typically rally in times of uncertainty, were mixed yesterday. Benchmark US 10-year treasuries climbed, but the equivalent sovereign bonds of Germany and the UK were sold off.

The 10-year government bonds of Australia and Japan were both weaker in Asian trade today.

Gold, which is often viewed as a safe harbour, was flat at $1,265.66 an ounce.

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of global peers, was down one-quarter of one per cent at 93.479. The euro gained 0.4 per cent to $1.1341.

The dollar has weakened in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision on June 15 to keep interest rates on hold, owing to weakness in the labour market and the possible disruption that could be cause by international hazards, such as an unruly Brexit outcome. Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, has reiterated that cautious tone this week in semi-annual testimony to congress, but has remained optimistic the economy will improve in the second half of this year, making higher interest rates appropriate.

The yen was 0.2 per cent weaker at ¥104.64 per dollar, but relatively unperturbed by data showing Japan’s manufacturing sector remained in contractionary territory in June for a fourth consecutive month, albeit with the pace of decline slowing marginally.

Oil prices were stronger, with Brent crude, the international benchmark up 0.8 per cent at $50.29 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, 1 per cent higher at $49.59.
