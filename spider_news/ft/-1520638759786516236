Royal Mint reports surge in gold trading before Brexit vote

2016-06-21

The UK’s Royal Mint online trading platform has reported a 32 per cent increase in transactions compared to last month, as British voters prepare to go to the polls on Thursday to decide on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

That has led to a 150 per cent rise in revenue this month compared to last month, Chris Howard, director of bullion at the Royal Mint, said.

Royalmintbullion.com allows users to buy gold and silver coins and bars and store them in a vault guarded by the Ministry of Defence 24 hours a day, reports Henry Sanderson, Commodities Correspondent.

Other online gold trading platforms have also reported a surge in volume. BullionVault said new UK account openings in June are 85 per cent ahead of the last 12 months’ daily average.

“This year’s widening financial and geopolitical risks are just finding a moment of concentration … in the high-volatility event of the Brexit referendum,” Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, said.
