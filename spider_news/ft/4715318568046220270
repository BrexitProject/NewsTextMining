Brexit fears send $1.1bn rushing out of UK equity funds

2016-06-17

Investors pulled over $1bn from UK equity funds in the week to Thursday, second only to the last general election over the past decade.

Flow of funds data showed a $1.1bn withdrawal from UK funds, the fastest pace of outflows in 13 months, according to data compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The figures underscore the extent of nervousness gripping markets ahead of what is set to be a tight result from the vote on the UK’s EU future on June 23.

Wider European equities were also not immune from the UK-induced jitters, witnessing a $4.7bn withdrawal – the worst weekly performance in seven, and the 19th consecutive week of outflows.

The rush out of equities and into perceived haven assets such as long-dated government bonds has sent yields on UK, German and Japanese debt to their lowest ever recorded levels in the past week.

BAML also noted investors pulling funds into classic “safe” retreats with $1.1bn flowing into precious metals funds over the same period.
