US banks on track for sharpest rally since May

2016-06-23

US bank stocks rallied by the most in more than a month on Thursday after polls that showed the ‘remain’ camp in the lead in the UK’s EU referendum whetted investor appetite for risk assets.

The S&P 500 banks index, which includes America’s largest lenders along with regional banks, jumped by 2.2 per cent, which would be the biggest rise since May 18, according to Bloomberg data. It also outpaced a 0.9 per cent rally by the broader S&P 500 and came after banks across Europe posted a strong performance.

Banks have struggled this year as the Federal Reserve has sharply pared its rate rise plans because of financial market volatility, mixed data on the US economy and headwinds from abroad. Concerns that UK voters may favour parting ways with the EU put additional pressure on lenders since a Brexit could weigh on banks’ European operations, analysts have said.

In fact, the banks index had tumbled by 11.3 per cent since the start of 2016 as of Wednesday’s close, compared with a broader market that has risen by 2 per cent.

Despite the rise on Thursday, US economic data need to improve for financials to find “long term support,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio research at Evercore ISI, an investment bank. In particular, inflation expectations, which are important since they tend to predict actual inflation, need to pick up in order to increase the odds of a Fed rate rise, Mr DeBusschere said.

Banks are particularly sensitive to short-term rates since they earn profits on the difference in the yield the receive from loans and their own borrowing costs.
