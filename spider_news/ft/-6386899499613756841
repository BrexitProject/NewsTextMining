IAG warns of weaker earnings growth post-Brexit

2016-06-24

International Consolidated Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, has downgraded its earnings growth forecast for this year in the wake of weaker trading ahead of the referendum, and expected volatility after the referendum.

The airline group, which topped forecasts yet again in the first quarter, said it “experienced a weaker than expected trading environment” in the run up to the referendum during June.

It warned:

Following the outcome of the referendum, and given current market volatility, while IAG continues to expect a significant increase in operating profit this year, it no longer expects to generate an absolute operating profit increase similar to 2015.

Although it insisted, “the vote to leave the European Union will not have a long term material impact on its business.”

IAG shares plunged as much as 33.7 per cent at the open this morning, and are now down 20 per cent, their biggest ever one-day drop by a long way, while the broader FTSE 100 is off 5.5 per cent.
