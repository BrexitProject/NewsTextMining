Brexit betting follows Scottish referendum pattern – Betfair

2016-06-21

Cash has been poured into betting markets just days ahead of Britain’s EU membership referendum, with £3.7m placed on the outcome of the vote on Monday alone, according to Betfair.

The betting company said the highest amount of bets placed on its exchange was on Monday, taking the total market to £42.8m, eclipsing the £35m staked through the exchange on the result of the World Cup final in 2014 and the £28m staked on Britain’s general election last year. It is now the single biggest political market in the bookmaker’s history.

Betfair’s exchange allows punters to bet against one another, unlike a traditional bookmaker.

Betting odds, which narrowed significantly in favour of the “leave” camp last week, have now swung decisively back in favour of Britain voting to stay in the EU. The implied probability of a “remain” vote is now at 76 per cent according to Betfair.

The recent moves in betting odds mimic a similar trend seen before the Scottish referendum in 2014 (see chart above).

At the moment, the bets placed through Betfair’s exchange suggest that the Remain camp could win 50-55 per cent of the overall vote. This is close to the eventual 55.3 per cent victory for the “better together” side in Scotland.

“The similarities between the Brexit market and the Scottish Referendum are striking”, said Naomi Totten at Betfair.
