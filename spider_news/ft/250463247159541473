Commodities stage broad retreat on economic worries

2016-06-16

Global economic growth fears gripped commodity investors on Thursday, depressing oil, industrial metals and grain markets.

Commodity bulls retreated after the US Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged raised worries about the strength of the economy. Jitters about Brexit also fed into worries about demand for raw materials.

Crude oil led the declines, with Brent, the international marker, falling 3 per cent for its sixth consecutive daily fall. It posted the longest losing streak since February, with the benchmark down more than 10 per cent since last week’s eight-month high of $52.86 a barrel. 

ICE August Brent weakened $1.52 to $47.45 a barrel, while Nymex July West Texas Intermediate was down $1.6, or 3.3 per cent, at $46.41 a barrel.

“Brent is now near some key test of support between $48.00 a barrel and $47.50 a barrel, representing the low of the range that traded in the second half of May,” said Olivier Jakob at consultancy Petromatrix.

Metals retreated on profit-taking, with copper for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange down 2 per cent to $4,553 a tonne. The red metal rallied earlier this week on reports of China’s stockpiling scheme, but INTL FCStone said investors may be questioning the amount of support it would provide for the metals markets. “This will do little, if anything, to rebalance the markets,” the broker said.

Lead for three month delivery on the LME fell 0.5 per cent to $1,689.50 a tonne, while Zinc retreated 1.9 per cent to $1997a tonne.

According to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, the global lead market showed a supply surplus of 23,000 tonnes in the first four months of the year compared to a shortfall a year before.

The ILZSG said Chinese usage of lead fell by 12 per cent in the January-April period, dragging down global demand by 2.5 per cent despite a 8,8 per cent rise in Europe. Supplies of zinc also outstripped demand by 24,000 tonnes, although the surplus was cut almost 90 per cent from the same period last year. 

Agricultural commodities lost ground as hedge funds took profits. Corn was down 1 per cent to $4.24¾ a bushel, while soyabeans declined 1.6 per cent to $11.37¼ a bushel.

Sugar initially rose to a two and a half year high of 20.15 cents a pound, rising above the 20 cents level for the first time since October 2013 on concerns about adverse weather in Brazil and India. However it later followed other commodities lower, losing 0.8 per cent to 19.60 cents a pound.
