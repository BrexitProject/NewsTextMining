FTSE 100 retreats with sterling; European stocks soften

2016-06-23

The FTSE 100 has hit the skids, giving up most of its earlier gains, while sterling wilts and European stocks also soften as we head to the closing bell in Europe. 

The FTSE 100 is up just 0.3 per cent now, down 1.6 per cent from the 2-month high it hit earlier this morning.

The index had jumped at the open and rallied strongly to its highest level since April as final Brexit polls, as well as bookmakers’ odds, swung in favour of ‘Remain’.

Sterling is still up strongly on the day – 0.6 per cent higher against the dollar – although it too has retreated from its earlier highs in mid-afternoon trading.

European stocks have also given up some of their gains.
