Sterling volatility hits record high as polls open

2016-06-23

As the polls open to rain-drenched pen/pencil-wielding Brits, referendum nerves are clearly on show as sterling overnight implied volatility rockets to a record high.

Overnight implied sterling volatility, reflecting the theoretical price of insuring against swings in the pound against the dollar, has surged to 106.23 per cent, an all-time high. At the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 it hit 67.95, writes Joel Lewin. (Good luck actually buying that protection, but this at least gives a sense of the scale of nerves.)

The pound was bolstered overnight by indications of a slim lead for ‘Remain’ in the polls, but this morning it has retreated slightly.

Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank says:

the market for sterling is likely to become very illiquid now and over the coming 40 hours. Perhaps there will be the odd trader to get cold feet who will adjust their positions at the last minute or try to hedge positions. But the majority of market participants will have a cup of tea (or another liquid) and just wait and see.

In the event of a Brexit, Ms Praefcke says:

Sterling will drop like a stone, safe havens like the Swiss franc, yen and dollar will appreciate, volatility will rise again. After all the Brexit would be a new “scenario” that the market would have to evaluate, It will be very difficult to assess as a result of the complex questions and far-reaching difficulties it would throw up, and therefore uncertainty on the market will be and will remain high.

Volatility will be one of the winners.
