HSBC predicts further 10% fall for sterling

2016-06-24

HSBC has laid out some post-Brexit market predictions. Spoiler alert: they’re not pretty.

Sterling has already been hammered since the Brexit referendum results emerged, plunging 10 per cent this morning to levels not seen since 1985, and HSBC predicts there will be worse to come.

The bank predicts sterling will slide a further 7 per cent to $1.25 by the third quarter, and 10 per cent to $1.20 by the end of the year.

“This is a seismic and largely unexpected event which is likely to have a massive impact on financial markets,” the bank said.

It highlighted several key risks, including:

the significant uncertainty regarding the UK’s trade and investment agreements with its biggest economic partner – the EU accounts for around 50% of the UK’s exports and around 50% of all its inward FDI – will make it much harder for the UK to finance these deficits. Sterling will act as the adjustment mechanism.

It also warned that the euro will be hit, and lowered its euro forecast for the end of 2016 to $1.10 from $1.20 previously.

It added:

In our view, the UK’s vote to leave the EU creates two negative headwinds for the euro. First, it will cause political contagion risks. Market participants could start to anticipate similar referendums on EU or Eurozone membership in countries with high levels of EU dissatisfaction.
