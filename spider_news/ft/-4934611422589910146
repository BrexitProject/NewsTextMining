US stocks set to zoom higher as Brexit fears ease

2016-06-20

US investors who took holiday last week were poised to see Wall Street much as they left as the opening bell rings on Monday, with the S&P 500 set to rally by more than 1 per cent.

The S&P 500 declined by 1.2 per cent last week in its worst performance since late April as worries about the potential for UK citizens to vote in favour of leaving in European Union sparked worries across global trading desks.

However, polls this weekend pointed to a rise in support for the “remain” camp ahead of this Thursday’s referendum, leaving the two sides in essentially a dead heat, according to the Financial Times’s poll of polls. That turn in sentiment cheered investors across the globe, with risk assets rallying sharply.

The pound lurched higher by 1.9 per cent against the US dollar, while the Euro Stoxx 600, a pan-European equity barometer, shot up by 3.7 per cent. Safe haven assets declined: Gold was off by 1.2 per cent to $1,283.4 a troy ounce, while the yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose by 4.6 basis points to 1.654 per cent.

Despite the bullish sentiment on Monday, market strategists warned that factors outside the Brexit vote could still spark another jolt in volatility. Indeed, several analysts warned that commentary from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen this week could be another source of tumult in the financial markets.

“We’ll all get off one roller coaster only to get on another,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.
