Oil pushes towards $51 on Brexit hopes

2016-06-23

Oil is another beneficiary of today’s Brexit-induced relief rally, with prices inching close to $51 a barrel on Thursday.

Brent crude, the world’s oil benchmark, is trading 91 cents higher, up 1.82 per cent to as high as $50.90 today. The day’s gain puts Brent back up more than 1 per cent for the week.

Prices are rallying as global stocks take comfort in latest evidence suggesting Britain will opt to stay in the EU in today’s referendum. Two polls carried out on June 22 have put the ‘Remain’ camp in the lead by 10 points and 4 points respectively.

West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, is up 1.63 per cent to $49.93, having fallen to as low as $48.16 earlier this week.
