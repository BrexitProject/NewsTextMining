Poll puts Remain on 55%, Leave 45% – Populus

2016-06-23

The last poll conducted before the result of the UK’s EU referendum has put the Remain side in the lead by 10 points at 55 per cent against 45 per cent for Leave.

The online survey from Populus was carried out with a sample size of 4700 from June 21 to midnight on June 22. Up until now, most online polling has given the pro-Brexit camp a healthy lead.

An earlier poll carried out by Ipsos Mori for the Evening Standard gave Remain a four point lead at 52 per cent, against 48 per cent for Leave.

Polls will shut at 10pm (BST) with the best indicator of results coming in from Friday morning.
