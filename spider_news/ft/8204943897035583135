Investors skittish at short-dated US debt auctions

2016-06-22

Investors backed away from auctions of shorter dated US government debt this week, uncertain of the potential outcome as the UK gears up to vote on whether or not to remain part of the European Union. However, yield hungry investors snapped up Wednesday’s $28bn sale of seven-year debt amid low and negative yields elsewhere.

Sales of two- and five-year debt saw lacklustre bidding from non-dealers, pushing the yield, which moves inversely to price, on the debt up in order for it to get sold. Non dealers took away 57.3 per cent of the $26bn two-year auction, compared to a 68 per cent average of the last four auctions, and 60.9 per cent of the $34bn five-year auction, versus a 72 per cent average, writes Joe Rennison in New York.

“The Brexit vote is so binary that unless an investor feels like they have special insight into the outcome, the sensible thing is to simply hold little risk into the ‎vote. Which makes the auctions harder to digest,” said Michael Cloherty, a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada.

Non-dealer bidding improved for Wednesday’s $28bn sale of seven-year debt, suggesting that concern is mainly focused on the impact to shorter dated debt, with longer dated securities supported by the Federal Reserve’s intent to raise interest rates going forward.

If the UK votes to remain in the EU then analysts expect some money to move back into European securities, which will likely see some investors leaving Treasuries, pushing yields higher, especially at the short end. If the UK votes to leave then the potentially volatility could spur investors into safe assets, such as Treasuries, pushing yields lower.

“It’s an acknowledgement that based on what (Fed chief) Janet Yellen has been saying and the broader outlook for the rate environment, regardless of the result you are ultimately going to want to be long the seven-year,” said Ian Lyngen at CRT Capital.
