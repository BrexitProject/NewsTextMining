Cyclical stocks slammed in Wall St sell-off

2016-06-24

A selloff at the start of the New York trading session was paced by declines in the financials and technology sectors, as investors shifted into haven assets.

Telecommunication and utility stocks, two industries generally considered less geared to the global economy with relatively stable cash flows and debt profiles, both slipped less than 0.5 per cent in the first few minutes of trading, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.

Financials, industrials and technology stocks were among the hardest hit, as concerns intensified over a slowdown in the global economy following the UK Brexit vote.
