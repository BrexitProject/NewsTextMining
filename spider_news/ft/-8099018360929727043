Remain rally runs out of puff in Asia

2016-06-22

The rally global markets have enjoyed this week stalled in Asia on Wednesday with most regional stock benchmarks heading lower, but the pound remaining buoyant a day out from the UK’s referendum on European Union membership.

The backdrop of the Brexit debate meant investors were less focused on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen’s semi-annual testimony to US congress yesterday, an even that is typically keenly watched.

Japan’s broad Topix was down 1.2 per cent while the Nikkei 225 was off by 1.1 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was 0.1 per cent lower, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.4 per cent.

On the mainland, China’s Shanghai Composite and the technology-focused Shenzhen Composite were both flat.

The British pound was up 0.2 per cent at $1.4681 in Asia today, ahead of Thursday’s EU referendum. Sterling had fallen 0.3 per cent on Tuesday, but weekend polls showing the Leave campaign vote was losing momentum saw the currency stage on Monday its biggest one-day rise since December 2008. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent on Tuesday amid a broad rally for European stocks.

The euro was up 0.1 per cent on Wednesday at $1.1254, but like most global currencies, had fallen on Tuesday as the US dollar strengthened.

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of peers, was up 0.1 per cent in Asian trade at 94.071. The greenback’s advance came in the lead up to Ms Yellen reiterating her cautious stance on the outlook for US monetary policy, but still keeping the door open to raising rates later this year.

Gold, which is typically sensitive to US interest rate expectations, fell 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, and was trading flat at $1,268.15 an ounce in Asia today. US treasuries also sold off yesterday in the wake of Ms Yellen’s testimony. Overnight, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher.

Japanese and Australian 10-year government bonds were selling off for the fourth session in a row, their longest losing streaks since mid-May and mid-April, respectively.

The yen was the best-performing Asian currency in Asia today, strengthening one-third of one per cent to ¥104.41 per dollar.

Oil prices were slightly firmer today, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, up 0.1 per cent to $50.68 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, up 0.2 per cent at $49.95.
