US stocks rally 1% as Brexit fears cool

2016-06-23

The S&P 500 jumped more than 1 per cent on Thursday in the broad market barometer’s best day in a month as investors cheered polls that hinted at a victory for ‘remain’ in the UK’s EU referendum.

The gains on the day, which brought the S&P 500 within less than 1 per cent of its all-time closing high notched last May, were led by economically-sensitive sectors.

Financials performed the best, followed by materials, energy and technology. Meanwhile, defensives that are favoured for their dividends and tend to perform well during times of uncertainty, fared the worst, with utilities and consumer staples lagging behind.

The British pound, seen as a proxy for sentiment about the referendum, recently climbed 1.1 per cent to $1.487. The dollar traded down by 0.2 per cent against a basket of six global currencies.

Traders also bid-up other risky assets: US crude oil prices rose 1.9 per cent to $50.07 a barrel, while Brent crude, the international marker, climbed by the same margin to $50.87 a barrel. Emerging markets currencies and stocks also continued their advice, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index closing 1.1 per cent higher and the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Currency Index climbing 0.6 per cent to hit its highest level in seven weeks.

Havens faced selling pressure, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rising 5.4 basis points to 1.739 per cent, and gold declining by 0.3 per cent to $1,261.9 a troy ounce.

Market strategists noted that the gains for US equities on Thursday could have been accelerated by investors unwinding hedges that they put in place to protect themselves against potential ructions caused by a ‘leave’ vote.

Indeed, the Vix index, a measure of expected volatility on the S&P 500 over the next month, plunged 17.2 per cent to 17.52 after notching its highest closing level in four months on Wednesday.
