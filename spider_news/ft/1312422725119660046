European banks and British builders enjoy Brexit boost

2016-06-20

Banks are the biggest risers across European stocks this morning, reflecting easing concerns that the UK may vote to leave the EU on Thursday, while UK building stocks are also rallying hard.

With latest polls showing ‘Remain’ regaining a slim lead over rivals and betting odds surging by as much as seven points this morning, lenders across the board have opened in the green.

Helping them along, yields on European debt have picked up. Last week, UBS warned that rock-bottom yields could knock 20 per cent off European banks’ earnings.

Deutsche Bank, whose shares had fallen to an all-time low last week, is up 5.8 per cent to €14.75 on Monday, while fellow German lender Commerzbank is up 4.4 per cent to €6.818.

Italian banks are also joining in with the rally despite voters delivering a bloody nose for prime minister Matteo Renzi in regional elections last night. UBI Bank is 8.5 per cent higher at €3.046 and Unicredit is up 6 per cent to €2.55

Having endured a tough week, Britain’s biggest housebuilders and property companies are also enjoying some Brexit-induced relief this morning.

Land Securities has jumped 5.7 per cent in early trading to £11.62, Berkeley Group is up 5.6 per cent at £32.37 and Persimmon is gaining 4.74 per cent to £20.34.

Berkeley had warned last week that jitters around the outcome of the referendum had exacerbated other problems in the market for high end properties in London and the south east, pushing down reservations on new homes by a fifth in the first five months of the year.
