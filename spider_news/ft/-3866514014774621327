Sterling fights back: nears the year’s high

2016-06-21

As you were. Nothing to see here.

Two days away from a UK referendum on EU membership that could send it plunging, sterling is pretty much back to where it started the year. It now stands at $1.4768. The only day this year when it has been stronger against the dollar was January 4.

As we wrote earlier, growing momentum for the Remain camp has given sterling a major shot in the arm over the past three trading days. That may prove to be wishful thinking on the part of sterling bulls, but it’s tough to stand in the way of it for now.
