Traders bet on US stock tumult long after Brexit vote

2016-06-21

US equity investors have braced themselves for a “prolonged period of higher volatility”, Deutsche Bank said this week, suggesting market jitters stem from more than just this week’s Brexit referendum.

Investors have increased S&P 500 volatility expectations not only in the near-term, but also over a very long period, with “unusually large moves” in implied volatility greater than 1 year out, Rocky Fishman, a strategist at Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients on Monday that analysed data on the price of options.

While market participants have been fixated on this week’s vote by UK citizens over whether the country should remain part of the European Union, a sharp rise in stock-market turbulence may actually come later this summer, Mr Fishman said.

“The UK referendum … seems like too telegraphed a catalyst to drive a further volatility spike, but we see heightened risk of a volatile selloff later in the summer,” he added.

US volatility gauges have also faced more turbulent swings in recent weeks despite relative calm in the equity market. For instance, the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility over the next month, surged to as high as 22.9 last week after starting June at about 14.

“Both the speed with which implied [volatility] jumped in the past week and a half and the disconnect between derivatives market stress and calm US equity market behavior are just about unprecedented,” Mr Fishman said.

The divergence between volatility expectations and realised volatility points to anxiety among traders who use options as a tool to hedge against market risks, Mr Fishman noted, adding:

If the Vix can be catapulted into the 20’s with no signs of actual realized vol, an actual volatile selloff, whenever that comes, could drive volatility sharply higher.
