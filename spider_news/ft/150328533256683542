UK’s EU referendum: Top stocks for Leave and Remain

2016-06-20

Friday’s child, says the proverb, is loving and giving. 

Whether or not Friday’s markets will fit that description will depend on the outcome of the UK’s referendum on EU membership. Or on where you look. 

Analysis from Liberum is pointing to opportunities on the stock market whichever way the vote goes.

It names free-to-air broadcaster ITV as the its top pick if Remain wins the day, with Wolseley, the world’s biggest distributor of plumbing and heating goods, as the best placed stock for a Leave vote.

Liberum points to recent experience in Spain ahead of the country’s general election, and reads across from it as it singles out ITV. 

“Spanish broadcasters sold off aggressively ahead of the election, as advertisers held back spend awaiting the result.” After it came in, writes Sebastian Jory, analyst, “advertising spend resumed in catch up mode and broadcasting share prices rallied.”

As for Wolseley, a major foreign currency earner, the expected slump in the pound after a Leave vote means it will be able to buy more sterling with its foreign revenues. 

“Wolseley makes around 80 per cent of operating profits from its US business, and a further 10 per cent from Canada, Nordics and central Europe. The shares look good value anyway after a recent comment that sales in the US had been somewhat slower in May.” 

Such analysis also shows how deeply Brexit risk has reached into the market, affecting a wide range of stocks with little else in common.
