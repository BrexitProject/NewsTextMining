Merkel, Hollande, Tusk, Renzi to meet for post-Brexit summit

2016-06-24

Chancellor Angela Merkel will host Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, European Council president Donald Tusk and French president Francois Hollande at a post-Brexit summit in Berlin on Monday.

The move to expand the meeting to the EU’s three top leaders and the highlights the chancellor’s determination to hold the EU together despite the political and populist pressures across the continent after the UK’s departure, reports Stefan Wagstyl in Berlin. 

The four will prepare for a European Council meeting, which is chaired by Mr Tusk, on Wednesday.

Ms Merkel expressed her “great regret” for the UK’s decision saying it was a “decisive point for Europe”. She emphasised the need for unity but also recognised that “Europe is varied and people in Europe are also varied” including in their “expectations from the EU”.

Future initiatives must focus on “improving people’s lives”. But the EU also had to deal with the challenges of globalisation, she said.

Ms Merkel added that the EU must recall its role in bringing peace to Europe.

“We must never forget, especially in these hours, that the idea of European unity was an idea for peace.”
