Online currency exchanges forced to shut on Brexit volatility

2016-06-23

Some digital currency exchanges have been forced to shut down temporarily by the withdrawal of electronic foreign exchange services by Barclays because of volatility around the UK referendum.

Marta Krupinska, co-founder of cross-border online money transfer start up Azimo, told the FT that its decision to suspend its service for two days because of Barclays’ withdrawal of electronic FX stop-loss orders, reports Martin Arnold, Banking editor. 

Azimo relies on Currency Cloud, a UK-based wholesale digital FX broker, to convert customer orders into 80 different currencies.

But Ms Krupinska said Currency Cloud depended on Barclays electronic FX platform to source it’s currency.

“We wanted to keep operating through this period, but we learnt at 9pm on Tuesday that we would not be able to do this and have since then been scrambling to message our customers and to go on social media to say we are suspending the service,” she said on the sidelines of the Wired Money conference in London.

She said being offline for two days would hit the company’s revenue plans.

“We are going to have to keep explaining this.”

Rival digital FX start-ups have also been disrupted by the UK referendum.

Transferwise, the UK-based money-transfer operator, said on Tuesday it would impose restrictions on transfers involving pounds beginning at 7am Thursday UK time until Friday when the referendum results are revealed.
