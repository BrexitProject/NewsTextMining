Farage: Brexit would be neutral for economy

2016-06-20

Leading Leave campaigner Nigel Farage says there is little economic advantage to quitting the EU, describing the choice as “even-stevens” but predicted the bloc was ultimately “doomed”.

“I would accept that economically, it’s about even-stevens. But I do think there is an issue called the quality of life. And if you can’t get a GP’s appointment, or your kids can’t get a house or you can’t get your 5-year old into a local primary school these are real issues,” the UK Independence party leader told BBC Radio 4′s Today programme, writes John Murray Brown. 

Asked if he would continue to campaign for an exit if voters rejected the proposition on Thursday, Mr Farage’s said the main consequence would be “we will not be the first country to leave the European Union”.

“The Danes, or the Swedes or the Dutch will beat us to it. Believe me this project is doomed.”

When questioned about the re-imposition of EU trade tariffs on trade wafter a possible Brexit, Mr Farage said “we have a rotten deal with the EU right now”

He insisted the UK could prosper outside the single market, observing the current low level of tariffs was “less than the annual annual currency movement between sterling and euro”.

On migration, he said the issue was about control and defended last week’s provocative Ukip campaign poster – featuring streams of Syrian and Afghan refugees in the Balkans under the heading “breaking point”.

“I didn’t invent the picture. The picture was real” he said. But he said it was “unfortunate timing” coming just ahead of the killing of Jo Cox, the Labour MP.

He declined to be drawn on how he would determine migration levels, but said it “would be good” to get net levels back to the post-war levels of 30,000 to 50,000.

“But ultimately this would be for the British parliament to decide. At the moment we have no control and a British passport is a European passport open to 500m people”.
