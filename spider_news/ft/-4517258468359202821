S&P 500 logs steepest weekly slide since April

2016-06-17

The S&P 500 dropped more than 1 per cent this week in the broad market gauge’s steepest decline since late April as investors took a cautious stance ahead of next week’s Brexit vote.

Market participants rotated into safe havens this week, with the S&P 500 telecommunications and utilities sectors, both seen as defensive plays, posting the best performance out of the major groups.

Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, declined modestly for the week despite pushing higher on Friday.

The more bearish stance comes as the referendum over whether the UK should remain part of the European Union looms less than a week away.

“June thus far has been all about the risk-off Brexit trade,” BofA Merrill Lynch told clients, pointing to the fall in Treasury yields and rise in other haven assets, like gold.

Meanwhile, investors increased their protection this week against the possibility of a sell-off in European corporate bonds, with activity in credit default swaps rising to the highest level since March.
