Metals traders sanguine over Brexit impact

2016-06-24

Copper fell as much as 4 per cent on Friday in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote, but traders on the floor of the London Metal Exchange, where Ukip leader Nigel Farage was once a broker, shrugged of the impact.

“The market is apprehensive but excitable,” one trader on the LME “Ring,” one of the last open outcry trading floors left in the world, said Friday, reports Henry Sanderson in London. 

“But things will start to calm down as people realize it’s going to take a year or two to sort everything out.”

The metals floor traders, who are almost all men, said they were about 50/50 split ahead of the vote about whether to leave or remain in the EU. “A lot of these boys are old school,” another trader said.

Nigel Farage was a broker on the LME before he went into politics. His brother also went into metals broking.

The metals market is driven by China so the impact of the UK leaving the EU is likely to have little impact, two traders said.

“To be honest we’re not a big player in commodities, it’s all about China,” one said. “The market has just followed the currency lower today.”
