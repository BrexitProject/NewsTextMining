Eurozone peripheral bond yields soar

2016-06-24

Brexit-induced jitters are making their presence felt in the European peripheral bond markets.

Yields on 10-year Greek debt have soared back up above 9 per cent having fallen below 7 per cent just a month ago after a breakthrough in the country’s bail-out talks. Moving inversely to prices, Greece’s yields are now at their highest level since late April.

In Italy, 10-year bond yields have jumped by 30 basis points (0.3 percentage points) to 1.688 per cent, while in Spain securities of equivalent maturity are up 34 basis points to 1.701 per cent – both trading at their highest levels since February’s market panic.

In Portugal, 10-year yields are trading at 3.475 per cent up by 40 basis points.
