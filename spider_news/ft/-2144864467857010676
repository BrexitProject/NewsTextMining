Europe’s EM currencies slide after Brexit

2016-06-24

Sterling isn’t the only currency taking a hit this morning, as emerging market European exchange rates are also under pressure.

The Czech koruna is down 3.8 per cent against the dollar to 24.647; Poland’s zloty has fallen 7.4 per cent to 4.11 per dollar, while the Hungarian forint is weaker by as much as 5 per cent to 290.4.

Eastern European countries outside the eurozone had been seen as most vulnerable to Britain’s exit from the bloc ahead of the vote.
