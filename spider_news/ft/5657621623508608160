Sterling hits new high, now up over 2%

2016-06-20

Hold on to your Union Jack hats. Sterling is heading to the moon.

Signs that the Remain camp has regained some momentum in the closing days of the painfully close EU referendum campaign have sent sterling soaring, and delivered a dent to UK government bonds.

The move in sterling started in Asia, but it has just hit new heights in early morning European trading, with the pound now up by over 2 per cent against the dollar – a very large move for a major currency pair. It’s now at $1.4650, the highest since late May.

This table, using data from Reuters, shows where this ranks in the biggest full-day gains for sterling in the last 10 years. It’s right up there.
