‘Eurosceptic genie is out of the bottle’ – Farage

2016-06-23

Ukip’s figurehead Nigel Farage has been speaking about the results of the referendum, noting that at this stage he’s “not conceding”, and claiming that the Remain campaign has “acted appallingly”, particularly with the extension of the deadline for voter registration.

He said:

It has been a long campaign, in my case 25 years and whatever happens tonight, we are winning this war.

The Eurosceptic genie is out of bottle and won’t be put back.

We will win this war. We will get our country back. We will get our borders back.
