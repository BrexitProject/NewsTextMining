Risk appetite fragile as UK counts votes

2016-06-23

Thursday 23.45 BST. Financial markets were highly volatile, led by a sudden fall in the pound as the early counting of UK referendum votes rattled investor optimism of a Remain outcome.

The pound has experienced a swing of 4.4 per cent in the past half-an hour, plunging to a low of $1.4295 from a high of $1.5018 as early counting was dominated by a strong Leave vote from Sunderland. 

That spurred a major reversal in risk appetite, with the yen sharply firmer while oil prices and S&P 500 futures dropped. 

“Right now is the most dangerous time in the markets because we have information asymmetry,’’ said Axel Merk, president of San Francisco-based Merk Investments. ‘’The market has priced in increasingly a Remain and now we have some numbers coming out that were tighter and even Leave.”

Ahead of Asian markets opening on Friday, liquid global proxies for risk appetite, namely currencies, S&P 500 futures and Brent crude were initially reflecting buoyant market sentiment.

The final opinion poll on the referendum — released after voting had finished — put the Remain campaign ahead with a 52 per cent share of the vote.

However, this was not an exit poll, as is traditionally carried out after elections, and analysts warned it should be treated with extreme caution.

Nevertheless, in the opening hour of a new trading day for the currency market, the pound hit $1.5018 against the US dollar, the highest since December, and up 0.9 per cent from the Reuters official close on Thursday of $1.4878. Just a week ago, the pound was within a whisker of dropping through the $1.40 level.

Sterling subsequently fell below $1.43 before recovering to $1.4625, down 1.7 per cent on the session.

The euro was up 1.6 per cent on the day against sterling at £0.7774, and down from Wednesday’s close of £0.7677. The yen rallied 1.1 per cent to ¥104.94.

James Knightley, economist at ING, noted that the markets had certainly been backing a Remain outcome in recent days.

“Making a big leap to assume these sample polls are correct, it should provide a near-term boost to the [UK] economy.

“If it is true, the slowdown in investment and hiring caused by the uncertainty that the vote has generated should reverse and the UK economy should revert towards trend growth.”

S&P futures rose in after-hours activity and oil topped $51 a barrel after UK polls closed at 10pm in London on Thursday. Haven currencies, the yen and swiss franc, came under selling pressure.

Stephen Innes senior trader at Oanda in Singapore said: “Market sentiment is extremely positive and we could be set for further upside. If we see a remain outcome, we should see further downside for the dollar.”

David Bloom, head of FX research for HSBC, said “basically the market has reacted, there’s a 90 per cent chance that there’s a Remain victory, so the big shock could be the other way”. 

The bank has predicted a $1.53 rate for the pound in the event of a Remain vote, and $1.25 were the UK to vote Leave. 

Analysts at JPMorgan argued that the idea that a wall of money would be unleashed into financial markets if the UK votes to remain in the EU — given pent-up foreign demand for UK assets — might be over-optimistic.

“There is little evidence of global investors’ underweights of UK assets, which is why short-covering in sterling might only take sterling/dollar to $1.51 and euro/sterling to £0.7550,” said John Normand, JPM’s head of foreign exchange research.

“We don’t doubt that a Remain outcome will extend this week’s decline in the dollar and gold and the bounce in oil and base metals on Friday. 

“But the wall of money that comes through in the following weeks may not be so overwhelming, which means markets would soon revert to moving on the old fundamentals rather than an overdue position adjustment.”

Regions will give clues but overall picture could be clear by 3.30am

As Britain’s voters went to the polls on Thursday, UK and European equities enjoyed a fifth successive day of gains — led by financials — and emerging market stocks and currencies pushed higher.

The UK’s FTSE 100 index ended 1.2 per cent higher at a two-month high of 6,338 — but off the day’s peak of 6,380.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 1.5 per cent stronger with the financial sector rising 2.1 per cent.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 equity index had its best day for a month as it regained the 2,100 level for the first time in a fortnight. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 2,113, while the CBOE Vix volatility index — watched as broad gauge of market nerves — was down 17 per cent in late trade at 17.5. 

The MSCI emerging markets equity index was up 0.9 per cent, its fifth gain in a row.

Energy stocks were also in good fettle as Brent oil rose 2.1 per cent to settle at $50.91 a barrel, and climbed above $51 post-settlement. Copper hit a seven-week high of $4,793 a tonne in London before closing 1.7 per cent firmer at $4,780.

Gold was down $10 at $1,255 an ounce, the day’s low.

Among those assets traditionally viewed as “havens”, government bond yields in Germany and the UK continued to pull away from recent record lows. 

The yield on the 10-year UK gilt, which moves inversely to its price, rose 7 basis points to 1.38 per cent — compared with a record low on June 16 of 1.07 per cent. 

The 10-year German Bund yield — in negative territory at the end of last week — rose 3bp on the day to 0.09 per cent and the that on the 10-year US Treasury was 6bp higher at 1.74 per cent.
